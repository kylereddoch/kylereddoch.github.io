## What's New?

Finally getting around to updating y'all on what I have been doing. I have been pretty busy with work and life in general. I have been working few chages to my site here that are now live and you should be seeing. Let's see if you can spot them. üòÉ I am also working on a new SwiftUI that will be available for both iOS, iPadOS, and Mac. I am pretty exicted about it. I will be sharing more information and updates about it on my [Mastodon](https://iosdev.space/@kylewritescode) account so be sure to follow me there.

I have also been working on a revamp of my personal brand. I have been working on a couple of new logos/icons that I will be using across all of my social media accounts, etc. I am pretty excited about it. I will have a press kit available soon that will have these logos/icons. Be on the lookout here for that soon. I have also moved way from using About.me and am now using [Bento](https://bento.me/kylereddoch) for the place to list all my social accounts, etc. Check it out!

### Apps I'm Using

**[Ivory from Tapbots](https://tapbots.com/ivory/)** - Ever since I packed up and left Twitter behind, I have been having a blast on Mastodon. One thing I found out early though in the web interface leaves a lot to be desired. I hate it! I quickly started looking for apps that would allow me to use Mastodon on my iPhone. I found a few, and some of them are really good. I then found Ivory from Tapbots (you know, the makers of Tweetbot). I was a faithful user of Tweetbot so it just seemed right to download it. I have been using it for a few months now and I love it. It is a great app and I highly recommend it. There's even a Mac version of it too though right now it is in beta.

**[CouchPal](https://apple.co/3v4Az3Y)** - I came across this app on Mastodon and have fallen in love with it! Mostly in part because the developer has added the feature of logging into your Mastodon account/instance and allowing you to be able to automatically post your watch history to your Mastodon account. Trakt currently doesn't have that, yet they are working on implementing this but I am impatient. CouchPal is also a wonderfully designed app and I am also working with the developer on polishing up and adding features to the app. You should give the app a try. There's also a TestFlight beta if you want to join. You can find that [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/3EZSoiKU).

I think that sum's it up for this update of What I'm Up To Right Now. Until next time, cheers üçª.
