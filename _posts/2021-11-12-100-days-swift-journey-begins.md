If you follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/winphankyle), you already know that I am starting my journey in developing for the Apple Ecosystem. It has been something that I've wanted to do for quite some time but have just either not had the time, or just been to lazy to take out the time. Probably the later. 😂

So to start I began looking online for various resources and groups to join to help me and allow me to ask questions along the way. I have found one really nice resource and a few groups I have joined.

## Hacking with Swift

Hacking with Swift is a resource website created by Paul Hudson. He has various free courses to help you learn [Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) and [SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). To take it even farther, he offers a paid [Hacking with Swift+](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/plus) subscription with tons of material.

## LinkedIn Groups

Here are the Linkedin groups that I found during my search that I think are going to be of tremendous help.

- [The Swift Programming Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8119756/)
- [Swift Developers](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8120324/)
- [SwiftUI & Combine](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/10536683/)

## Reddit

I also decided to join some subreddits, becuase why not? There's some good questions being asked in them.

- [The Swift Programming Language r/Swift](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/)
- [SwiftUI r/SwiftUI](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftUI/)
- [Learn Objective-C r/learnobjectivec](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnobjectivec/)
