It has been quite some time since my last blog post. The reason for this hiatus is due to my efforts in revamping my blog. I decided to change the framework of my blog a while back. Previously, my blog was running on Jekyll and hosted with Github Pages, which I had no complaints about as I am a fan of Jekyll's geeky style.

However, a few months ago, I stumbled upon [Omg.lol](https://omg.lol){:target="_blank"}, a fantastic service offering [profile pages](https://profile.kylereddoch.me), [now pages](https://now.kylereddoch.me), blogging, and more. I have thoroughly enjoyed using it and have decided to make it my new blogging platform. [Adam](https://adam.omg.lol){:target="_blank"} and the entire Omg team have been incredibly welcoming and the community they have built is truly remarkable.

## What will readers find on Kyleâ€™s Tech Korner?

I will be sharing my experiences navigating the ever-evolving world of technology. There won't be a specific theme for this blog, as I plan to write about whatever topics pique my interest. However, I will be using a hashtag system to categorize posts for those looking for specific topics.

Some of the subjects I plan to cover include technology, my thoughts on the latest tech trends, cybersecurity news and its impact on society, and various other musings.

The design you see now is a work in progress. I have been striving to find the perfect look and feel for my blog, but due to my busy schedule with work, family, and personal commitments, I haven't been able to dedicate as much time to it as I would like. I have decided to launch it now and will continue to refine it over time.

This new chapter is just beginning, so stay tuned for more updates!
