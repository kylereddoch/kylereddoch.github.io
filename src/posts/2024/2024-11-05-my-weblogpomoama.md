Annie set a [WeblogPoMo challenge](https://weblogpomo.club/challenges) for this month, an Ask Me Anything:

> I'm calling this challenge WeblogPoMo AMA (Ask Me Anything). For this challenge I want to foster writer interaction: write a blog post starting with a question—the AMA—and then answer the question yourself in the blog post.

I decided to ask my questions on my Mastodon account, which you can view [my Mastodon AMA post](https://allthingstech.social/@beardedtechguy/113419565493796147).

**If you were going to be stranded on an island by yourself for 30 days, what are the top three things you would take with you and why? No need to take food, clothes or basic supplies, as those will be provided.**

Basic supplies could be subjective per person, so without getting into too much detail, my top three would be:

- **My iPad** - I can have my library of Apple Books to read.
- **My wife** - so I can have company. She is also my other half and completes me.
- **Solar charging bank** - I can keep my iPad charged.

**Guilty pleasure?**

Okay, now, this one is easy for me—Reese’s peanut butter cups. I can easily lose count of eating these and make myself sick.

**In your IT career, what's the closest you’ve ever come to hiring a hitman?**

Well, unfortunately, I have never been in the position of hiring personnel. So I guess I missed out, or dodged a bullet.

**If you could have any one superpower, what would it be and why?**

Time travel—is that a superpower? I think it would be awesome. I have always had a huge liking for history, and being able to travel back to important times in history and see/experience them would be great.

**If you happen to win the lottery, what would be the first transaction you would do with the new wealth?**

Easy—I would first pay off all my debt. That is the most important thing and what is causing us the most stress. After that, if there is any left, we can invest and spend on other stuff.

**What is the an every day carry that you can not go out of the house without?**

There are actually 2 things. My iPhone and Apple Watch. I have gotten so used to wearing an Apple Watch that if I am not wearing it, I feel naked without it. My iPhone is such an integral part of my day, I do so much on it, I couldn’t leave without it.

**What's your comfort movie/show/piece of media, and - if you feel like sharing - why?**

When my brother and I were younger, we would go to our cousin’s house during the summer, and his mom would watch us during the day. My grandma would drive us as they lived in the same town where she worked. During the drive, we would listen to “Could Have Been True” by the Mavericks and sing the song at the top of our lungs. Now that my grandma is in her mid 80’s and has dementia, this song always brings me comfort and memories of those times.

**What’s one song that never fails to cheer you up?**

Ooh, I have a few, actually. If you know me well, I am a big Taylor Swift fan so when I need a good pick me up, one song that I go to is Shake It Off. If I have bad energy that is holding me down, I just have to remind myself I just need to shake it off and keep moving. Another song that I listen to to cheer me up is Can’t Stop the Feeling by Justin Timberlake.
