I have been toying around with the idea of creating an iPhone wall in my office for some time now. I got the idea from Drew as seen on many of his [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@TailosiveTech). I **_fell in love_** with his wall of all those iPhone boxes the first time I saw it in one of his videos. That nostalgia just hit me!

So now, I am getting around to starting my own iPhone wall. I'm not sure how I am going to lay it out just yet as my skills as an interior decorator aren't near as good as that of a tech person. For those of you that haven't seen Drew's wall, his is laid out like this:

I am targeting something similar but not copycat-ish. I have also thought about mixing in some iPad boxes...maybe. Depends on how it would love.

## I need your help

I am reaching out to my fellow Apple community to see if anyone has iPhone boxes spanning any iPhone (3G-now), any color, that would be willing to part with or have no need for anymore. **It would be greatly appreciated!** This project means a lot to me. In return, I will be making a post of me putting the phone box on the wall in its position and shouting out the person who sent it on my [socials](https://profiles.kylereddoch.me){:target="_blank"}. You can even sign at the bottom of the box to make the project more personal and fun!

So let's all make this project a reality. You can reach me at ```kyle@kylereddoch.com``` or on [Mastodon](https://allthingstech.social/@beardedtechguy){:target="_blank"}.
