Proton’s most popular product, [Proton Mail](https://go.getproton.me/SH1F7), a secure, end-to-end encrypted email service, has swiped their prices tremendously. Usually priced at $4.99/month for the Mail Plus package, for Black Friday, you can get a whopping 60% off! Until December 2nd, you can get the Mail Plus package, which includes Proton Mail and Proton Calendar, for just $1.99/month for 12 months.

This is the lowest I have seen Proton Mail Plus ever since I have been using Proton and have been a partner.
