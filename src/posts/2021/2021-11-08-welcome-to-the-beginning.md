First off, let me thank you all for coming. It has taken me way to long to create a place that I can share shortcuts (take a look at my [Shortcuts Gallery](/shortcuts-gallery)), ï£¿ tech/news, my journey in coding, and more with those interested. I hope you enjoy.

This journey has been a wild, but good one. For this site I decided to do something different. Testing my skills, I went with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} as the backbone of it. The theme comes from [Sylhare](https://github.com/sylhare){:target="_blank"} on Github. Then it is being hosted on [Github Pages](https://github.com/kylereddoch/kylereddoch.github.io){:target="_blank"}. 

Have a look at the [About](/about) page to get to know a little bit about me. You can also find me at the following places below (social icons).
