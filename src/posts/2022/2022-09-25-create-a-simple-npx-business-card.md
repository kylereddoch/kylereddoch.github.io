One of the most common things we Software Engineers do is tinker with code. That is what I have done with Javascript and NodeJS.

I created a CLI tool that uses a custom npm package to display a nerdy style business card. Here is how I created it:

#### Using javascript for CLIs is easy

- the npm build, publish, and share cycle is so easy
- ``npx`` allows you to execute without installation
- the npm ecosystem is ripe for CLIs

## npx business card

**We will be using the command line to during part of this tutorial.**

Let's start creating this business card. The final output might look something like this: (I have customized this quite a bit to my needs)

### npm init

First, let's start off by creating a new ``node`` project and name it whatever you want. I would suggest naming it after the exectuable you want to expose. You don't have to but naming conventions are good and it makes it more ``npx`` friendly.

```bash
mkdir kylereddoch
cd kylereddoch
npm init -y
```

Now, let's get the neccessary CLI working. I named mine card.js but you can name yours whatever you want.

```bash
touch card.js
chmod +x card.js
```

Now that the file is created, open the file in your favorite editor. I am partial to ``vs code`` but you can use any editor you want.

Once you open the file, it will be blank. Let's add some ``test`` code.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log('doing business')
```

Now within the same folder you created, you can execute the file like this:

```bash
./card.js
```

### ship it

You know have a functional first release of your CLI tool. Now, let's ship it.

If you do not already have a npm account you can create one either online at [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com/) or by using cli as follows and following the directions:

```bash
npm adduser
```

Once you have created a user, you can login to npm by using the following command:

```bash
npm login
```

Once you are logged in, you can publish your CLI to the world!

```bash
npm publish
```

Once you have published your CLI, anyone can install it globally by using the following command:

```bash
npx kylereddoch
```

### making updates

Now that you have published your CLI, you can make updates to it and publish them. You can also update the version number in your ``package.json`` file and publish it as a new version.

If you want to update the version number using the command line, you can do so by using the following commands:

To update the version number to a major release:

```bash
npm version major
```

To update the version number to a minor release:

```bash
npm version minor
```

Or to update the version number to a patch release:

```bash
npm version patch
```

Once you have updated the version number, you can publish it to npm by using the following command:

```bash
npm publish
```
