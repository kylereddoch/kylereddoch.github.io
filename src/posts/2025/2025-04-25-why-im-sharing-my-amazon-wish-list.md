Every now and then, people ask if thereâ€™s a way they can [support](https://purl.kylereddoch.me/kofi) what Iâ€™m doingâ€”whether itâ€™s the work I share online, the projects Iâ€™m building, or just life in general. Iâ€™ve always appreciated the thought, but I never really had a clear answer.

Lately, a few of those conversations have come up again, so I decided to put together an Amazon wish list. Itâ€™s mostly made up of tech-related itemsâ€”things that would help streamline my setup, improve how I work, or support some of the behind-the-scenes parts of what I do.

I want to be clear: this isnâ€™t a request or expectation. Iâ€™m not posting this because I need anyone to buy anything. But for those whoâ€™ve asked (and meant it), I figured Iâ€™d share it openly. If you feel like contributing, hereâ€™s the link:

If not, no worries at allâ€”just reading, sharing, or showing support in your own way means a lot.

Thanks for reading, and thanks even more for just being here.
