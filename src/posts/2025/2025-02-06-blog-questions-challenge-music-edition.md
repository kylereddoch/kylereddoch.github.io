Well, here is another edition of the Blog Questions challenge. This time, it’s about music, and you’ve guessed it correctly: I’ve been tagged again by [Cliff](https://seerofsouls.com).

### What Are Five Of Your Favorite Albums?

- **Blink-182** - Blink-182
- **Hybrid Theory** - Linkin Park
- **The Wall** - Pink Floyd
- **News of the World** - Queen
- **American Idiot** - Green Day

### What Are Five Of Your Favorite Songs?

- **I Should Have Been True** - The Mavericks (this has sentimental value)
- **Livin on a Prayer** - Bon Jovi
- **I’m Lost Without You** - Blink-182
- **Numb** - Linkin Park
- **Wonderwall** - Oasis

### Favorite Instrument(s)?

- Guitar
- Drums

I’ve always thought it would be cool to be able to play them.

### What Song Or Album Are You Currently Listening To?

Right, right now? None. I am currently listening to podcasts. But I do have a couple of albums that I have been recently listening to:

- **From Zero** - Linkin Park
- **Exploration 84** - Waveshaper

### Do You Listen To The Radio, And If So, How Often?

I occasionally do, but it’s not usually just when I forget to plug in my Apple CarPlay or for short car rides. I am not a fan of the radio and all the stupid ads.

### How Often Do You Listen To Music?

Probably less than I should. Recently, I have been more into podcasts, which has caused me to listen to music less often. I am trying to balance them now.

### How Often Do You Discover Music And How Do You Discover It?

I discover new music pretty frequently. Usually, it is from my kids, TV shows I watch, and recommendations from friends. I occasionally use the recommendation feature on Apple Music to find new songs and have even found new ones I like.

### What’s A Song Or Album You Enjoy That You Wish Had More Recognition?

- **Air I Breathe** - Mat Kearney

### What’s Your Favorite Song Of All Time?

Okay, WOW, this is going to be a difficult one to answer. I have come across so many great songs throughout my life. Being able to narrow it down to just one favorite? That’s downright dastardly…

Okay, for the sake of this post, I guess I will have to go with the following; 

- **Zombie** - The Cranberries

### Has Your Taste Of Music Evolved Over The Years?

I have always liked a variety of music. I grew up listening to country inspired by my grandparents and parents. My parents also listened to music from the 70s and 80s in the Rock and Pop genre. As I got into my high school years, the Rap genre started to get into the mix but that soon got outlived.

Now I listen to pretty much everything BUT Rap. My favorites are 80s, 90s, Alternative, Rock, EDM, and Country.

This blog challenge was a hard one for me to complete. I hope [tekphloyd](https://tekphloyd.com) and [Graham](https://ghall.blog) have an easier time on it. **TAG** you’re it!
