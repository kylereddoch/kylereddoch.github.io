## üîí Cybersecurity Weekly Roundup ‚Äì July 12‚Äì18, 2025

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [U.S. Energy Grid Hit by Sophisticated Phishing Campaign](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/us-energy-grid-hit-by-phishing-campaign-july2025)

A coordinated phishing campaign targeted critical U.S. energy firms this week. Attackers used credential harvesting and VPN abuse to gain lateral access to SCADA networks. CISA advises enforcing MFA and improving AD security baselines to reduce risk.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [New Variant of BlackSuit Ransomware Targets Healthcare Sector](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blacksuit-ransomware-variant-targets-healthcare-july2025/)

A new BlackSuit ransomware variant is actively exploiting legacy VPNs in hospitals. The malware employs DNS tunneling and intermittent encryption to bypass traditional EDR systems. Healthcare IT teams should tighten VPN access and analyze outbound DNS behavior.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ [Zero-Day Vulnerability in Apache Struts Under Active Exploitation](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/apache-struts-zero-day-exploited.html)

CVE-2025-37845, a critical Apache Struts RCE flaw, is being exploited in the wild. Attackers are injecting malicious OGNL expressions into HTTP headers. Java web applications using Struts must be patched immediately to avoid compromise.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ [Microsoft July Patch Tuesday Fixes 140 Vulnerabilities, 6 Critical](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2025-Jul)

Microsoft‚Äôs latest update cycle fixed 140 CVEs, including six critical ones. A privilege escalation flaw (CVE-2025-34567) in the Windows kernel is under active exploitation. Enterprises should prioritize patching Exchange, Defender, and Windows Server instances.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ [MITRE Releases Adversary Emulation Plan for Industrial Control Systems](https://www.mitre.org/news/mitre-ics-emulation-plan-july2025)

MITRE has published a detailed adversary emulation scenario to help Red Teams test ICS/OT defenses. It simulates threat actors targeting manufacturing and energy sectors, aiming to help defenders bolster segmentation and detection capabilities.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ [AI-Generated Malware Bypassing Legacy Antivirus Detected](https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ai-generated-malware-july2025)

Polymorphic malware generated by AI models has been detected in the wild. It rewrites itself to avoid static detection and deploys obfuscation at runtime. Security teams should emphasize behavior-based EDR and sandboxing to identify these threats.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ [China-Linked APT 'Volt Typhoon' Targets Undersea Cable Operators](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/volt-typhoon-undersea-cable-attack-july2025)

APT group Volt Typhoon is reportedly targeting Pacific undersea cable operators. The campaign involves living-off-the-land attacks and the use of outdated Fortinet vulnerabilities. This suggests strategic intelligence gathering on the communications infrastructure.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ [Okta Data Breach: Over 12,000 Customer Records Exposed](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/okta-data-breach-2025-customer-records/)

Okta disclosed a breach exposing metadata for over 12,000 customers. The attacker used stolen admin credentials but did not access authentication tokens. Okta users should rotate admin passwords and verify audit logs for suspicious access.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ [New Research: Quantum-Resistant Encryption Slows Down Critical Applications by 30%](https://www.wired.com/story/quantum-encryption-performance-hit-july2025/)

Researchers found that quantum-safe encryption (like Kyber and Dilithium) adds up to 30% latency in edge and real-time applications. Organizations must assess trade-offs between performance and long-term cryptographic resilience.

### üîü [FBI Launches Cyber Talent Pipeline Program](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-cyber-talent-program-july2025)

The FBI unveiled a new Cyber Talent Pipeline to train and recruit cybersecurity talent. It targets students and career changers, with a focus on SOC analysis and threat intelligence. The move aims to address the cyber workforce shortage.
