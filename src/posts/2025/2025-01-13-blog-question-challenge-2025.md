Well, because [Jason](https://cool-as-heck.blog) tagged me…

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I’ve been blogging off and on (_mostly off_) since the early 2000’s. However, all those have been lost to history and mainly consisted of random thoughts on tech, etc. I guess, the reason I started blogging was everyone else was and I wanted to get “my name” out there also.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog, and why do you use it?

When I recently got back into blogging, about a couple of years ago, I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) housed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The developer in me loved using Jekyll and building out my blog posts in markdown and then pushing them to GH for publishing. I know pretty geeky.

Now, though, I have moved over to [Adam’s](https://adam.omg.lol/) [weblog.lol](https://weblog.lol) blogging platform that is part of [OMG.lol](https://omg.lol). Since I have most of my stuff on OMG, it was just easier to have my blog there and keep everything in one place. Plus, it is easy to use and have markdown capability.

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

I have been on and tested out way too many blogging platforms to count, some of which never even made the cut to be my main platform.

If my memory serves me correctly, this goes back 20-some years now; I started writing on my MySpace page. Just writing down short things, thoughts, etc. Then as I started to become more serious with blogging, like most others, I used WordPress.

More recently, as mentioned above, I used Jekyll. There shortly, I tried [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), [Scribbles](https://scribbles.page/), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) but neither of them stuck.

## How do you write your posts?

Most of the time I use [Ulysses](https://www.ulysses.app) to draft up my posts. I **love markdown** so using Ulysses, being able to write them up in markdown is simple, and then I can just copy and paste them into the web editor of weblog. Sometimes though, I live on the wild side and just write them directly in the web editor of weblog. The only problem with that is that, weblog doesn’t have a save as draft, it is only publish.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

I’ve never been a great or even a good writer. I struggle to come up with words or subjects to write about. So, if I write a blog post, it is usually when I have some kind of personal thing to talk about, some technology came out that I have a take on, something regarding my field of work, etc.

## Do you normally publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit?

Most of my posts are written and then posted immediately afterward. I don’t have a lot of free time, I’m afraid that if I write a post and let it sit, I will forget about it completely.

## What's your favorite post on your blog?

What is it with everyone and the “favorite” question? :)

This is a difficult question to answer. When I moved my blog from Jekyll to Weblog, I elected to not move over those posts and start fresh. So I guess the favorite one out of the posts on Weblog would be [The iPhone Wall Project](https://weblog.kylereddoch.me/2024/09/the-iphone-wall-project)as it is something dear to me. I am trying to get an iPhone wall started in my office. I haven’t had much luck/traction yet.

## Any future plans for the blog?

I have done quite a lot of work on weblog to customize it and extend it far beyond what it was meant to be. For now, I am pretty happy where I am, both design-wise and service-wise. Although Adam is working on a brand-new, powerful, feature-rich blogging platform named [Neato](https://neato.pub) that I will move to when it is ready.

## Who will participate next?
