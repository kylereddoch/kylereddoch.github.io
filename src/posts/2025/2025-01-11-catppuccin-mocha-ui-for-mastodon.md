I first signed up for Mastodon back in 2018 on mastodon.social but after that, really never did anything with it. I was more active on Twitter like most other people. But, as Twitter started to decline after [Elon bought it](https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/11/23019836/elon-musk-twitter-board-of-directors-news-updates), I decided to give Mastodon another look. I moved around different instances at first but then finally found a home on [allthingstech.social](https://allthingstech.social) where I am a co-admin along with [@cliffwade](https://allthingstech.social@cliffwade).

## The Mastodon UI

After I moved to Mastodon, I started to feel like this was the place to be. People were welcoming, conversations were more engaging. Even though my following numbers were nowhere near those I had on Twitter, it felt like the quality here on Mastodon was way better. I felt something was off though. The Mastodon UI is good, but the Twitter UI's aesthetics were just **beautiful and felt "modern"**. I am not saying that Mastodon should be just like Twitter, be let's face it, Mastodon's UI could use a bit of an upgrade.

## Enter BirdUI

Coming from a web development background, I thought about tweaking the UI of Mastodon to allow for my own aesthetic liking. Unfortunately, my schedule doesn't have that much extra wiggle room for the amount of time it would take.

Gratefully, [Rolle](https://mementomori.social/@rolle) spent the time to create the _exact thing_. His [Mastodon BirdUI](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/mastodon-bird-ui) is inspired by the aesthetics and beauty of the Twitter UI but made for Mastodon. It is everything I was asking for!

I have been using Rolle's BirdUI ever since he released it. I use Mastodon in a multi-column view on the web. If you use his multi-column layout, you know that the compose section is on the right. Now, coming from Twitter and using Tweetdeck for so many years, I am used to the compose section being on the left, and honestly, it just makes sense.

I edited BirdUI to shift the compose section to the left and make the columns a little narrower. I had finally found my true Mastodon bliss!

## A new BirdUI theme

My friend, [Jason Crabtree (@jcrabapple)](https://dmv.community/@jcrabapple), created a [Catppuccin Mocha](https://cool-as-heck.blog/mastodon-birdui-catppuccin-mocha/) inspired theme of the BirdUI. I have to say, this theme looks AMAZING as I love the [Catppuccin palete](https://catppuccin.com/palette). As I did with Rolle's BirdUI, I have made some modifications to suit my personal needs. This time though, I have decided to make those public for anyone to use.

Now, if you like Rolle's BirdUI, and Jason's Catppuccin Mocha-inspired colors, but want my modifications (left compose section and slightly narrower columns, at 350px in width) you can now install it.

This is the first release so there may still be some bugs. If you come across any, you can open an issue on GitHub or just email me.
