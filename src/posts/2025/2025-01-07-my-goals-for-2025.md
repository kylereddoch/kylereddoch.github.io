I have always had difficulty keeping the resolutions I've set for myself in the new year. Whether I get busy and forget about them, lose interest in them, or get discouraged and say screw it.

This year, I am going to reword them to **Goals**. This way, it sounds not so hurtful if I don't quite reach any of them. :)

So, the goals for 2025 that I'm reaching to complete are:

- Read 3 books. (You can keep up with the progress over on my [Hardcover profile](https://hardcover.app/@beardedtechguy))
- Write more. (I have never been a good writer, nor was English my best subject in school. I am trying to write/blog more to help with that. You can follow my blogging here of course)
- Expand my Cybersecurity knowledge.
- Be a **better** father & husband.
- Move the [AllThingsTech.social](https://allthingstech.social) Mastodon instance to a self-hosted instance.
- Get out of debt.

Goals are better when we help each other out! What are your goals? Maybe we can keep each other on track throughout the year.
