Hey everyone,

It’s been a while since I’ve posted anything new here, so I figured it’s time to check in and explain what’s been going on. Some of you might’ve noticed things have been pretty quiet around the site — and a few of you who follow me elsewhere might’ve wondered where I’ve disappeared to. Short answer: I’m still here. Just caught in the chaos of life.

### A Quick Note About the Name Change

If you follow me over on Mastodon or other platforms, you’ve probably seen me using the name **CybersecKyle**. That’s a shift I’ve been slowly working toward — but here on the blog, I’m still showing up as **BeardedTechGuy**.

The name change isn’t anything dramatic. Just a bit of a personal rebrand to reflect where my focus is headed: more cybersecurity, less general tech. But I haven’t fully pulled the trigger here yet. So if you see me switching between the two, that’s why. Same person. Same voice. Just evolving.

Now… back to why it’s been so quiet.

### School: The Never-Ending Grind

Right now, school is probably the biggest thing draining my energy. I’m inching closer to graduation (only eight classes to go), but it’s been exhausting. Between assignments, projects, and just the mental effort of keeping everything straight, it’s a lot. Burnout from coursework alone is very real.

### Work: Nonstop

Work isn’t any lighter. My days are packed from start to finish. Honestly, most evenings I get home and have nothing left in the tank. I don’t even bother picking up my phone half the time — just crash in front of the TV to let my brain idle for a while.

### Life Offline: Also a Rollercoaster

And that’s not even counting the personal and family stuff going on. Nothing catastrophic, but enough challenges and curveballs to keep me running on empty. Mentally, it’s felt like trying to navigate a storm without a map.

### Burnout and Stalled Motivation

The honest truth? I’ve been burned out. Not the spectacular, crash-and-burn burnout — more like the slow-drip kind that sneaks up on you. Somewhere along the line, my motivation just dropped. The things I used to love doing — writing here, sharing ideas, tinkering with side projects — started to feel like extra weight instead of something enjoyable.

### What Comes Next?

I’m not here to announce some grand relaunch or promise regular content starting tomorrow. But I’m working on pulling myself out of the rut. Small steps. Rebuilding momentum. Trying to reconnect with the parts of tech and security that excite me again.

So, if you’ve stuck around: thank you. Seriously. It means more than you know.

And while **BeardedTechGuy** might still be the name on this site for now, **CybersecKyle** is here too — working behind the scenes, slowly getting back to posting more consistently.

Talk soon.
