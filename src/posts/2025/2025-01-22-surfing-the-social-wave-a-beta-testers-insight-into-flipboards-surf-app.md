As a beta tester for [Flipboard’s](https://flipboard.com) Surf app, I’ve had the chance to explore what could be a major shift in how we interact with the open social web. Designed as a social browser, Surf combines content from various platforms, offering a customizable, user-focused experience. In this review, I’ll share my insights, highlight its standout features, and explain how you can participate in the experience.

## First Impressions: What is Surf?  

At its core, [Surf](https://about.surf.social) aligns with the vision of the **IndieWeb movement**, which focuses on decentralization and user control over their online presence. By integrating platforms like Mastodon, Bluesky (coming soon), Threads, RSS feeds, podcasts, and YouTube, Surf empowers users to take control of their digital experience.  

This philosophy resonates with what Mike discusses in his post, [“Surfing the Social Web”](https://shellsharks.com/notes/2025/01/22/surfing-the-social-web). Surf goes beyond simply aggregating content; it embodies a mission to promote autonomy and create a seamless browsing experience in a fragmented online world.

## Key Features of Surf  

### 1. Customizable Feeds  

One of Surf’s most powerful features is its **feed customization**. You can pull content from your favorite sources and organize them into unique feeds tailored to your interests. Whether it’s tech news, photography, or AI advancements, Surf gives you the tools to curate content that matters most to you.  

This customization highlights the importance of enhancing user engagement. By empowering the user to control the experience, Surf ensures that users see what they want, how they want it, and when they want it.

### 2. Nested Feeds for Deeper Organization  

For those who love structure, Surf introduces **nested feeds**. Think of it as a hierarchy for your content. You can create a primary feed for technology and add sub-feeds for specific topics like coding tutorials or gadget reviews.  

This level of organization makes browsing easier and reflects Surf’s commitment to helping users manage information overload effectively.  

### 3. Seamless Mastodon Integration  

Surf is designed with the open social web in mind, and its **Mastodon integration** is a perfect example. You can follow accounts, interact with posts, and even **post directly to Mastodon** from within the app.  

This seamless experience eliminates the need to switch between platforms, streamlining your interactions with decentralized networks.

### 4. Bluesky Support on the Horizon  

During a recent meeting with the Flipboard team, we discussed their roadmap for Surf. One of the most exciting updates is the **upcoming integration of Bluesky accounts**, which will further expand Surf’s capabilities.  

The meeting was a fantastic opportunity to share feedback and learn more about the team’s plans. The team is clearly dedicated to building a tool that not only meets but anticipates user needs.

### 5. A Polished User Experience  

Surf combines functionality with a sleek, user-friendly design. Whether you’re reading an article, watching a video, or listening to a podcast, the app delivers a smooth and visually engaging experience.
