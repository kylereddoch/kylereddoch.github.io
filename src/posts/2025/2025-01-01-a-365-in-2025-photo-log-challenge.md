As we bring in a new year and say goodbye to yet another one, I thought it would be nice to do a challenge. I haven't been good at these in the past though. A friend of The AllthingsTech.social community and on Mastodon, [Andrew Melder](https://melder.social/@andrew), created this photo challenge so I am hoping I can get some help to complete it.

### Here is how the challenge goes

Each day of 2025, post a photo and tag it with **#365in25** and then share it across on the Fediverse. That photo can be shared on Pixelfed, your website via a photo log, Threads (with activity pub activated), etc. The photos don't need to be anything special either. You can be in your house cooking dinner, in your yard, on a trip, etc. The goal is to just have some fun this year.

I posted my first photo on my [Pixelfed](https://allthingstech.social/@beardedtechguy/113754530980859401) account. Join in on the fun!
