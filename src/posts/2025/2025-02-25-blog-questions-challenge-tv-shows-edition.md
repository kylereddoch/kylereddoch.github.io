It’s time for another Blog Question Challenge. I think this makes the fourth for me now. I’ve done the [blog one](https://weblog.kylereddoch.me/2025/01/blog-question-challenge-2025), then the [technology](https://weblog.kylereddoch.me/2025/02/blog-questions-challenge-technology-edition) one, then we had the [music](https://weblog.kylereddoch.me/2025/02/blog-questions-challenge-music-edition) one. I am afraid this might not stop. LOL.

Anyways, thanks to [Cliff](https://https://www.seerofsouls.com/blog-questions-challenge-tv-shows-edition/) for tagging me on this TV edition one so here goes nothing…

> TV shows have a way of making us feel connected—not just to the stories they tell but to the characters who bring them to life. Whether they make us laugh, cry, or see the world differently, certain shows leave a lasting impact.

Here are my answers to the latest Blog Questions Challenge, TV Edition!

## 1. What TV Character From A Beloved Show Do You Wish You Could Be Best Friends With In Real Life?

If I had the chance to be best friends with any TV character, I’d choose John Dutton from [Yellowstone](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4236770/). On the surface, John is a hardened rancher, a man who’s spent his life protecting his family’s land and legacy against powerful outside forces. But beneath that tough exterior lies a man of profound wisdom, loyalty, and integrity.

John is the kind of friend who would always have your back, no matter the odds. He’s someone who values honesty and respect, and while he may not be the most openly affectionate person, his actions always speak louder than words. A friendship with him would mean gaining an unwavering supporter, someone who would give you the hard truths when necessary but also guide you with wisdom earned from a lifetime of struggle.

Beyond that, John’s deep connection to nature and the land is something I deeply admire. Spending time at the Yellowstone Ranch, riding horses at sunrise, and learning life lessons from a man who has seen it all—that would be an incredible experience. The loyalty he shows to his family and close friends is something truly rare, and I would be honored to have a friendship like that in real life.

## 2. If You Could Binge-Watch An Entire Series Again For The First Time, Which One Would You Choose And Why?

If I could wipe my memory and experience a show for the first time all over again, it would be The [Big Bang Theory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/). This show brought so much joy, laughter, and even unexpected heartfelt moments that I’d love to relive it with fresh eyes.

One of the best things about The Big Bang Theory is its balance of humor and character development. At first, it’s just a quirky sitcom about a group of socially awkward scientists, but over time, the characters grow in ways that make you feel truly invested in their journeys. Watching Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, Raj, and Penny evolve over the seasons was such a fun experience, and I’d love to go through it all again, not knowing what’s coming next.

Plus, the show is packed with so many clever jokes and pop culture references that rewatching it for the first time would allow me to rediscover all those little details that made it so great. There’s something special about watching a show that makes you laugh out loud, feel for the characters, and escape into a world of friendship and nerdy fun. If I could have that first-time experience again, I absolutely would.

## 3. Name A TV Show That Changed Your Perspective On The World Or Taught You Something Valuable.

For me, the TV show that left the biggest impact on my perspective was [This Is Us](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5555260/). More than just a drama, this series is a deeply moving exploration of life, love, loss, and the invisible threads that connect us all.

The show follows the Pearson family across different generations, weaving together past and present in a way that highlights how the choices we make—and the experiences we endure—shape who we become. What I love most about This Is Us is its raw honesty. It doesn’t shy away from the difficult moments—grief, addiction, trauma, and mental health struggles—but it also reminds us of the beauty in everyday life: a father’s love for his children, the strength of a marriage, the importance of self-discovery, and the way small moments can define an entire lifetime.

One of the biggest lessons This Is Us taught me is the power of empathy. It showed that everyone is fighting battles we don’t always see, and that understanding someone’s past can give us greater compassion for who they are today. It also reinforced the importance of family, whether by blood or by choice, and how love endures even through the hardest of times.

Every episode left me reflecting on my own relationships and experiences, making me more appreciative of the moments I have with the people I love. It’s rare for a TV show to make such a lasting emotional impact, but This Is Us did just that.

### Final Thoughts

TV shows aren’t just entertainment—they have the power to inspire, teach, and shape our perspectives. Whether it’s through characters we admire, stories that make us laugh, or narratives that touch our hearts, certain shows stay with us long after the credits roll.
