Redragon has built a solid reputation for making high-quality, budget-friendly peripherals, and their latest entry, the **Behemoth K724 Pro**, aims to push the boundaries even further. With a **gasket-mounted design**, **hot-swappable switches**, **tri-mode connectivity**, and a unique **TFT "Info-Island" screen**, this keyboard offers a lot on paper. But does it live up to the hype? Let’s find out.

## **Design and Build Quality**

</div>

The **[Behemoth K724 Pro](https://redragonshop.com/products/behemoth-k724-pro?_pos=1&_psq=behem&_ss=e&_v=1.0)** doesn’t just rely on its feature set; it also boasts an impressive build. The **81-key layout** gives it a **compact feel** while still retaining a function row—something many enthusiasts appreciate for productivity and gaming. The overall design looks premium, with a **sleek black case, south-facing RGB lighting, and a well-thought-out keycap font.**

One of the biggest selling points is its **gasket-mounted structure**. Unlike traditional tray-mounted keyboards, a gasket mount provides a **more flexible and bouncy typing feel**, making each keystroke softer and more satisfying. The inclusion of **3.5mm PORON foam, IXPE switch foam, PET sound-dampening layers, and silicone pads** means that Redragon has put serious effort into **reducing hollow sounds and improving acoustics**—something many budget keyboards fail to address.

Simply put, this is a **keyboard that feels much more premium than its price suggests.**

## **Typing Experience – Smooth and Satisfying**

</div>

Redragon has opted for their own **Mint Mambo linear switches**, which come **pre-lubed from the factory.** These switches feel incredibly smooth right out of the box, avoiding the scratchiness that often plagues budget mechanical keyboards. If you’re into customization, you’ll be happy to know that the keyboard features **hot-swappable sockets** (compatible with **both 3-pin and 5-pin switches**), making it easy to swap in your favorite switches without any soldering.

Stabilizers are another area where budget keyboards often struggle, but **Redragon has done a commendable job here.** The stabilizers are well-lubed, reducing any annoying rattle on larger keys like the **spacebar, enter, and shift keys.**

Whether you’re typing up documents, coding, or gaming, the **Behemoth K724 Pro delivers a satisfying, thocky, and well-balanced typing experience.**

## **Connectivity and Features – Where the K724 Pro Shines**

<div align="center">

</div>

If you’re looking for **versatility**, the K724 Pro delivers in spades. The keyboard features **tri-mode connectivity**, including:

- **Wired USB-C** (for the lowest latency and best performance)
- **Bluetooth 3.0/5.0** (great for multi-device users)
- **2.4GHz Wireless** (for a seamless, lag-free experience)

Switching between devices is incredibly simple, and the **low-latency wireless mode** performs surprisingly well, even for competitive gaming. Battery life is also **solid**, thanks to the **4000mAh battery** inside. Expect **multiple days of usage on a single charge**, even with RGB turned on.

One of the standout features is the **1.41-inch TFT "Info-Island" screen**. This tiny display can show your connection mode, battery status, and even animated GIFs for some added personality. While it’s not an essential feature, it’s a fun and unique addition that adds to the keyboard’s appeal.

The **control knob** on the top right corner is another highlight. It allows for **quick volume adjustments, media controls, and RGB brightness changes**—a small but practical addition that makes daily use more enjoyable.

## **Software and Customization**

Redragon’s software suite has come a long way, and the **K724 Pro supports full customization** via its dedicated software. You can:

- **Remap keys** to your liking
- **Set up macros** for work or gaming
- **Customize RGB lighting** with various effects and color options
- **Upload custom GIFs** to the TFT display

While the software isn’t as polished as what you’d get from premium brands like Razer or Corsair, it’s functional and gets the job done.

## **Gaming Performance**
