In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, organizations continually seek effective strategies to bolster their defenses. In a recent poll I conducted within the cybersecurity community on Mastodon, I posted the question: **How should organizations run cybersecurity drills?** The options I gave were:

- _Announced_
- _Unannounced_
- _Mixed_

Out of 191 participants, the results were as follows:

- **Announced:** 13%
- **Unannounced:** 21%
- **Mixed:** 61%

These findings highlight a significant preference for a blended approach. Let's delve into the implications of each method and explore the community's insights on this topic.

## Announced Drills

#### Pros:

- **Preparation:** Employees can allocate time and resources, ensuring comprehensive participation.
- **Educational Value:** Provides an opportunity for staff to learn and understand protocols without the pressure of spontaneity.
- **Systematic Evaluation:** Allows for a structured assessment of procedures and identification of areas for improvement.

#### Cons:

- **Potential for Atypical Behavior:** Knowing in advance may lead to behavior that's not reflective of daily practices.
- **Limited Stress Testing:** Doesn't effectively measure how employees handle unexpected situations.

## Unannounced Drills

#### Pros:

- **Realistic Assessment:** Offers a genuine evaluation of the organization's readiness and response under pressure.
- **Behavioral Insights:** Reveals natural reactions and potential gaps in knowledge or protocol adherence.

#### Cons:

- **Stress Induction:** Can cause anxiety among employees, potentially affecting morale.
- **Operational Disruption:** May interfere with critical tasks or lead to unintended consequences if not managed carefully.

## Community Insights

Several community members provided valuable perspectives on this topic:

- **Brian [@bh](https://suarez.social/@bh/113874913875719523):** Stressed the importance of education and support. Both announced and unannounced drills are necessary for effective preparedness, but employees need to be equipped with the knowledge and tools to succeed. Unannounced drills alone risk creating hostility and paranoia. Management should focus on accountability and fostering a supportive environment.

- **Matt [@Slater450413](https://infosec.exchange/@Slater450413/113875988833395209):** Highlighted that even unannounced drills must account for environmental and workload factors. Planners need to be mindful of timing and context—for example, not conducting a fire drill during an actual fire.

- **[@serialcomplainer](https://infosec.exchange/@serialcomplainer/113876210948900604):** Cited research showing that surprise testing, such as phishing campaigns, can often be ineffective or counterproductive. Incident rehearsals and other drills should be planned but executed in ways that still reveal gaps and unpreparedness.

- **Karsten [@ksaj](https://infosec.exchange/@ksaj/113898275718530592):** Shared a method of using gentler testing techniques. By giving employees a presentation and informing them of potential future tests with rewards for correct actions, organizations can encourage positive behaviors without fostering anxiety.

## Impact on Business

The approach an organization takes in conducting cybersecurity drills can have several implications:

- **Employee Performance:** Announced drills may enhance learning and confidence, while unannounced drills can test resilience and adaptability.
- **Resource Allocation:** Announced drills allow for planned resource deployment, whereas unannounced drills test the effectiveness of current resource availability.
- **Policy and Procedure Evaluation:** A mixed approach ensures that both the theoretical and practical aspects of cybersecurity policies are effectively assessed.

## Conclusion

The poll results and community feedback underscore the value of a balanced approach to cybersecurity drills. By integrating both announced and unannounced exercises, organizations can comprehensively evaluate their preparedness, enhance employee training, and strengthen overall security posture.

It's essential to consider organizational culture, the specific objectives of the drills, and the potential impacts on employees when designing and implementing these exercises. By thoughtfully combining both announced and unannounced drills, organizations can create a robust cybersecurity strategy that prepares employees for various scenarios while maintaining trust and morale.
