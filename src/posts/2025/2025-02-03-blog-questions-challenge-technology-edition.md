Well here is another edition of the Blog Questions Challenge. This time it's about technology and I was tagged by [Cliff](https://www.seerofsouls.com) so here it goes.

### When Did You First Get Interested In Technology?

My fascination with technology ignited during my childhood (around 8 or 9) in Western Montana. The arrival of our first computer, running [Windows 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95), was a pivotal moment. I spent countless hours exploring its capabilities, from playing educational games like [Oregon Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(series)) to navigating the early days of the internet. The thrill of discovery and the endless possibilities that technology offered captivated me from the start.

### What’s Your Favorite Piece Of Technology All-Time?

Reflecting on the technological advancements over the years, the **[Palm Treo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Treo)** stands out as my all-time favorite. Long before the dominance of modern smartphones, the Palm Treo was a game-changer. It combined a mobile phone with a personal digital assistant (PDA), giving users access to email, contacts, and even rudimentary web browsing on the go. With its full QWERTY keyboard and touchscreen functionality, it set the stage for the mobile revolution that followed. It was one of the earliest devices that truly blended productivity and communication into a single device, making it an essential tool for tech enthusiasts and professionals alike.

### What’s Your Favorite Piece Of Technology Right Now?

Currently, I'm particularly impressed by **e-ink displays and e-readers**, like the [Kindle Scribe](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-scribe) and the [Remarkable tablet](https://remarkable.com/). The ability to mimic the feel of paper while providing digital convenience has transformed reading and note-taking. Unlike traditional screens, e-ink displays are easier on the eyes, energy-efficient, and offer an immersive reading experience without distractions. Whether it’s for reading books, annotating documents, or taking handwritten notes, this technology continues to evolve in exciting ways.

### Name One New Cool Piece Of Technology We’ll Have In 25 Years!

Looking ahead 25 years, I envision the emergence of fully immersive virtual reality (VR) environments that seamlessly integrate with our daily lives. The foundations of this transformation were laid by [Meta](https://about.fb.com/realitylabs/) with their investment in VR through the Oculus line, but now, [Apple](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/) is spearheading innovation with the **Apple Vision Pro**. This marks a shift toward mixed-reality experiences that blend digital content with the physical world. In the future, I see VR evolving beyond entertainment into virtual workspaces, immersive education, and even fully digital urban landscapes where people can interact in ways that feel as natural as in-person meetings. The fusion of VR with advancements in haptic feedback, artificial intelligence, and ultra-high-resolution displays will redefine how we engage with technology in our everyday lives.

### Final Thoughts

Technology has been a constant companion throughout my life, evolving from the bulky desktops of the past to the sleek, powerful devices we use today. It's a field that never ceases to amaze me with its rapid advancements and the profound impact it has on society. As I continue my journey, personally and professionally, I remain excited about the innovations on the horizon and their potential to transform our world.
