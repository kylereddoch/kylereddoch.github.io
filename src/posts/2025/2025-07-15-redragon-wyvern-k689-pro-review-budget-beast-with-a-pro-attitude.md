## First Impressions: Aggressive, Compact, Ready to Work

The Redragon WYVERN K689 PRO wastes no time making a statement. Right out of the box, this 75% mechanical keyboard is compact without feeling cramped, minimalist without looking cheap, and clearly built to punch above its price point. The matte black body paired with floating keycaps and understated branding sets the tone: this isn’t just a budget board. It’s a budget board with ambition.

![Unboxing]()

The K689 PRO ships with a detachable USB-C cable, wireless USB dongle, keycap puller, and user manual. It supports **three connection modes**: wired via USB-C, Bluetooth, and 2.4GHz wireless using the included dongle. For under $60, that's impressive.

## Design & Build Quality: Sturdy and Clean

The keyboard has a solid plastic frame with zero flex. Despite the plastic housing, the build feels tight and durable. The weight gives it just enough heft to stay in place during gaming sessions, yet it's portable enough for travel or remote setups.

The 75% layout is a practical middle ground. You retain the arrow keys and function row while cutting out the excess. It’s ideal for gamers, coders, and multitaskers who want performance without giving up too much desk space.

The keycaps are double-shot ABS. They're decent for the price, but like most ABS caps, they will develop shine with heavy use. The legends are sharp and the surface texture feels smooth but not slippery.

## Switches: Clicky Blues, Hot-Swap Ready

The unit comes with Redragon Blue switches—tactile, clicky, and loud. If you're into mechanical typing sounds and tactile bumps, you'll love them. If you're in a shared space or stream without a noise filter, they might be a bit much.

One of the best features: **hot-swappable sockets**. This means you can swap out the stock switches for almost any other 3-pin or 5-pin mechanical switch, no soldering needed. Want to try silent linears or heavier tactiles? Go for it.

## RGB Lighting: Customizable, But Slightly Dim

![RGB Showcase]()

The RGB is fully per-key and supports a wide range of effects, all controllable via the keyboard or Redragon’s software. The lighting is smooth, and colors transition cleanly, but brightness is slightly underwhelming—especially when compared to something like the Redragon Behemoth K724 PRO (full review [here](https://weblog.kylereddoch.me/2025/03/review-redragon-behemoth-k724-pro-a-feature-packed-powerhouse)).

This isn’t a dealbreaker, but if vibrant RGB is a top priority, the K724 PRO edges it out.

The software offers customization of lighting, key remapping, and macros. It’s functional, but the UI feels dated and takes a few minutes to get used to.

## Typing & Gaming Experience: Solid All-Around

The K689 PRO is responsive and satisfying to type on. Key actuation is snappy, stabilizers are decent out of the box, and anti-ghosting performs well. 

For gaming, the 75% layout keeps everything tight and efficient without sacrificing core keys. For productivity, the clicky switches offer tactile feedback that makes long typing sessions enjoyable—if you’re okay with the noise.

Wireless modes work smoothly. Latency over 2.4GHz is minimal, making it completely usable for casual to competitive gaming. Bluetooth mode works well with mobile devices or tablets, though not ideal for latency-sensitive tasks.

## Downsides: Not Dealbreakers, But Worth Mentioning

- The stock ABS keycaps will show wear over time.
- The software is basic and could use a UI update.
- RGB brightness is a bit dim compared to higher-tier boards.

That’s about it. No fake logos on the spacebar. And yes—wireless is built in.

## Final Verdict: Feature-Rich, Budget-Friendly

![Final Glam]()

At under $60, the Redragon WYVERN K689 PRO delivers serious value. You get:

- Tri-mode connectivity (USB-C, Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless)
- Hot-swappable switches
- Per-key RGB
- A space-saving 75% layout

If you're looking to dip into mechanical keyboards or want an affordable, customizable daily driver, the K689 PRO is one of the best bang-for-buck boards out there.
