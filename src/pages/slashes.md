This is my [/slashes](https://slashpages.net/){:target="_blank"} page. It's dedicated to documenting all my /slashes pages. Feel free to take a look at all of them below!

<blockquote><p>Slash pages are common pages you can add to your website, usually with a standard, root-level slug-like <code>/now</code>, <code>/about</code>, or <code>/uses</code>. They tend to describe the individual behind the site and are distinguishing characteristics of the IndieWeb.</p>
