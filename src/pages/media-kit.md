If you found this page, it means you might be interested in partnering on a collaboration with me on my social media platforms. This is great and I appreciate you taking the time to read this page! This page will include the links to my Media Kit, logos, and social media platforms.

I collaborate with brands, companies, and individuals who align with my values and interests in technology, cybersecurity, and IT. If you think we would be a good fit, please reach out!

### Media Kit

This media kit includes a short about me, brands I've worked with, and some branding guidelines I try to follow. My media kit can be downloaded [here](../assets/pdf/MediaKit.pdf)!

### Social Media Links

The following social media links are ordered from the most used to the least used. I try to post at least twice a week on Instagram and am starting my Twitch/YouTube channels with the plan on going live once a week. TikTok I am not that active on, but I will improve on that.
