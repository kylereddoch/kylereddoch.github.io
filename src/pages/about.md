I am what they call a millennial, the last generation that grew up seeing the introduction of the internet and technology as we know it today. Because of that, I grew to love technology ever since my parent bought our first computer with Windows 95 on it. From there, it was goodbye stone-age, hello technology age.

I am self-taught at all I do, and I currently do not have any degree. I have done programming, web development, and internet marketing. My true passion, though, is in the field of IT. I currently work in the MSP field managing clients' endpoints, networking, servers, etc. The company I work for also handles clients' cybersecurity threats so I am getting into that area as well.

Currently, I am getting my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the University of Phoenix.

I also love to do side projects in my spare time that either contribute to the open-source community or just help others out.
