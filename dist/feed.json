      "content_html": "<p>Hey everyone,</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve posted anything new here, so I figured it‚Äôs time to check in and explain what‚Äôs been going on. Some of you might‚Äôve noticed things have been pretty quiet around the site ‚Äî and a few of you who follow me elsewhere might‚Äôve wondered where I‚Äôve disappeared to. Short answer: I‚Äôm still here. Just caught in the chaos of life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-quick-note-about-the-name-change\"><a href=\"#a-quick-note-about-the-name-change\" class=\"heading-anchor\">A Quick Note About the Name Change</a></h3>\n<p>If you follow me over on Mastodon or other platforms, you‚Äôve probably seen me using the name <strong>CybersecKyle</strong>. That‚Äôs a shift I‚Äôve been slowly working toward ‚Äî but here on the blog, I‚Äôm still showing up as <strong>BeardedTechGuy</strong>.</p>\n<p>The name change isn‚Äôt anything dramatic. Just a bit of a personal rebrand to reflect where my focus is headed: more cybersecurity, less general tech. But I haven‚Äôt fully pulled the trigger here yet. So if you see me switching between the two, that‚Äôs why. Same person. Same voice. Just evolving.</p>\n<p>Now‚Ä¶ back to why it‚Äôs been so quiet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"school-the-never-ending-grind\"><a href=\"#school-the-never-ending-grind\" class=\"heading-anchor\">School: The Never-Ending Grind</a></h3>\n<p>Right now, school is probably the biggest thing draining my energy. I‚Äôm inching closer to graduation (only eight classes to go), but it‚Äôs been exhausting. Between assignments, projects, and just the mental effort of keeping everything straight, it‚Äôs a lot. Burnout from coursework alone is very real.</p>\n<h3 id=\"work-nonstop\"><a href=\"#work-nonstop\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Work: Nonstop</a></h3>\n<p>Work isn‚Äôt any lighter. My days are packed from start to finish. Honestly, most evenings I get home and have nothing left in the tank. I don‚Äôt even bother picking up my phone half the time ‚Äî just crash in front of the TV to let my brain idle for a while.</p>\n<h3 id=\"life-offline-also-a-rollercoaster\"><a href=\"#life-offline-also-a-rollercoaster\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Life Offline: Also a Rollercoaster</a></h3>\n<p>And that‚Äôs not even counting the personal and family stuff going on. Nothing catastrophic, but enough challenges and curveballs to keep me running on empty. Mentally, it‚Äôs felt like trying to navigate a storm without a map.</p>\n<h3 id=\"burnout-and-stalled-motivation\"><a href=\"#burnout-and-stalled-motivation\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Burnout and Stalled Motivation</a></h3>\n<p>The honest truth? I‚Äôve been burned out. Not the spectacular, crash-and-burn burnout ‚Äî more like the slow-drip kind that sneaks up on you. Somewhere along the line, my motivation just dropped. The things I used to love doing ‚Äî writing here, sharing ideas, tinkering with side projects ‚Äî started to feel like extra weight instead of something enjoyable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-comes-next\"><a href=\"#what-comes-next\" class=\"heading-anchor\">What Comes Next?</a></h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm not here to announce some grand relaunch or promise regular content starting tomorrow. But I‚Äôm working on pulling myself out of the rut. Small steps. Rebuilding momentum. Trying to reconnect with the parts of tech and security that excite me again.</p>\n<p>So, if you‚Äôve stuck around: thank you. Seriously. It means more than you know.</p>\n<p>And while <strong>BeardedTechGuy</strong> might still be the name on this site for now, <strong>CybersecKyle</strong> is here too ‚Äî working behind the scenes, slowly getting back to posting more consistently.</p>\n<p>Talk soon.</p>\n<p>‚Äî BeardedTechGuy (aka CybersecKyle)</p>\n",

Right out of the box, this 75% mechanical keyboard is compact without feeling cramped, minimalist without looking cheap, and clearly built to punch above its price point. The matte black body paired with floating keycaps and understated branding sets the tone: this isn‚Äôt just a budget board. It‚Äôs a budget board with ambition.</p>\n<p><img src alt=\"Unboxing\" eleventy:widths=\"650,960,1400\"></p>\n<p>The K689 PRO ships with a detachable USB-C cable, wireless USB dongle, keycap puller, and user manual. It supports <strong>three connection modes</strong>: wired via USB-C, Bluetooth, and 2.4GHz wireless using the included dongle. For under $60, that‚Äôs impressive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"design-and-build-quality-sturdy-and-clean\"><a href=\"#design-and-build-quality-sturdy-and-clean\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Design &amp; Build Quality: Sturdy and Clean</a></h2>\n<p>The keyboard has a solid plastic frame with zero flex. Despite the plastic housing, the build feels tight and durable. The weight gives it just enough heft to stay in place during gaming sessions, yet it‚Äôs portable enough for travel or remote setups.</p>\n<p>The 75% layout is a practical middle ground. You retain the arrow keys and function row while cutting out the excess. It‚Äôs ideal for gamers, coders, and multitaskers who want performance without giving up too much desk space.</p>\n<p><img src alt=\"Top View\" eleventy:widths=\"650,960,1400\"></p>\n<p>The keycaps are double-shot ABS. They‚Äôre decent for the price, but like most ABS caps, they will develop shine with heavy use. The legends are sharp and the surface texture feels smooth but not slippery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"switches-clicky-blues-hot-swap-ready\"><a href=\"#switches-clicky-blues-hot-swap-ready\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Switches: Clicky Blues, Hot-Swap Ready</a></h2>\n<p>The unit comes with Redragon Blue switches‚Äîtactile, clicky, and loud. If you‚Äôre into mechanical typing sounds and tactile bumps, you‚Äôll love them. If you‚Äôre in a shared space or stream without a noise filter, they might be a bit much.</p>\n<p>One of the best features: <strong>hot-swappable sockets</strong>. This means you can swap out the stock switches for almost any other 3-pin or 5-pin mechanical switch, no soldering needed. Want to try silent linears or heavier tactiles? Go for it.</p>\n<p><img src alt=\"Switch Pull\" eleventy:widths=\"650,960,1400\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"rgb-lighting-customizable-but-slightly-dim\"><a href=\"#rgb-lighting-customizable-but-slightly-dim\" class=\"heading-anchor\">RGB Lighting: Customizable, But Slightly Dim</a></h2>\n<p><img src alt=\"RGB Showcase\" eleventy:widths=\"650,960,1400\"></p>\n<p>The RGB is fully per-key and supports a wide range of effects, all controllable via the keyboard or Redragon‚Äôs software. The lighting is smooth, and colors transition cleanly, but brightness is slightly underwhelming‚Äîespecially when compared to something like the Redragon Behemoth K724 PRO (full review <a href=\"https://weblog.kylereddoch.me/2025/03/review-redragon-behemoth-k724-pro-a-feature-packed-powerhouse\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>This isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker, but if vibrant RGB is a top priority, the K724 PRO edges it out.</p>\n<p>The software offers customization of lighting, key remapping, and macros. It‚Äôs functional, but the UI feels dated and takes a few minutes to get used to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typing-and-gaming-experience-solid-all-around\"><a href=\"#typing-and-gaming-experience-solid-all-around\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Typing &amp; Gaming Experience: Solid All-Around</a></h2>\n<p>The K689 PRO is responsive and satisfying to type on. Key actuation is snappy, stabilizers are decent out of the box, and anti-ghosting performs well.</p>\n<p>For gaming, the 75% layout keeps everything tight and efficient without sacrificing core keys. For productivity, the clicky switches offer tactile feedback that makes long typing sessions enjoyable‚Äîif you‚Äôre okay with the noise.</p>\n<p>Wireless modes work smoothly. Latency over 2.4GHz is minimal, making it completely usable for casual to competitive gaming. Bluetooth mode works well with mobile devices or tablets, though not ideal for latency-sensitive tasks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downsides-not-dealbreakers-but-worth-mentioning\"><a href=\"#downsides-not-dealbreakers-but-worth-mentioning\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Downsides: Not Dealbreakers, But Worth Mentioning</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The stock ABS keycaps will show wear over time.</li>\n<li>The software is basic and could use a UI update.</li>\n<li>RGB brightness is a bit dim compared to higher-tier boards.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That‚Äôs about it. No fake logos on the spacebar. And yes‚Äîwireless is built in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-verdict-feature-rich-budget-friendly\"><a href=\"#final-verdict-feature-rich-budget-friendly\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Final Verdict: Feature-Rich, Budget-Friendly</a></h2>\n<p><img src alt=\"Final Glam\" eleventy:widths=\"650,960,1400\"></p>\n<p>At under $60, the Redragon WYVERN K689 PRO delivers serious value. You get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tri-mode connectivity (USB-C, Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless)</li>\n<li>Hot-swappable switches</li>\n<li>Per-key RGB</li>\n<li>A space-saving 75% layout</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you‚Äôre looking to dip into mechanical keyboards or want an affordable, customizable daily driver, the K689 PRO is one of the best bang-for-buck boards out there.</p>\n<p><strong>Buy It If:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You want a hot-swappable board under $100</li>\n<li>You like clicky, tactile switches</li>\n<li>You want wireless + wired connectivity</li>\n<li>You value compact layout with solid performance</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Skip It If:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You need ultra-bright RGB</li>\n<li>You prefer silent switches</li>\n<li>You want PBT keycaps out of the box</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"save-10percent-with-my-discount-code\"><a href=\"#save-10percent-with-my-discount-code\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Save 10% with my Discount Code!</a></h2>\n<p>Thanks to the awesome folks over at Redragon for giving me the opportunity to review this product.

With its ergonomic design, customizable buttons, and eye-catching RGB lighting, this mouse aims to deliver high performance at a budget-friendly price. But does it live up to expectations? Let‚Äôs dive in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"design-and-build-quality\"><a href=\"#design-and-build-quality\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Design &amp; Build Quality</a></h2>\n<h4 id=\"rating-‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ-4/5-stars\"><a href=\"#rating-‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ-4/5-stars\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4/5 Stars)</a></h4>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fredgradon_m612_hro.png&amp;width=650&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform 650w\" sizes=\"auto\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fredgradon_m612_hro.png&amp;width=650&amp;format=jpeg&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"M612 Hero Image\" width=\"650\" height=\"650\"></picture></p>\n</div>\n<p>Right out of the box, the M612 Pro impresses with its sleek, ergonomic design. The frosted, skin-friendly coating provides a comfortable grip, making it ideal for extended gaming sessions. The rubberized side texture enhances control, giving the mouse a premium feel despite its budget pricing.</p>\n<p>One standout design element is the inclusion of seven programmable buttons. Positioned well for accessibility, these buttons cater to MMO, FPS, and productivity users alike. However, the plastic build, while solid, doesn‚Äôt match the premium feel of more expensive alternatives.

The mouse‚Äôs optical sensor delivers reliable tracking, though it may not match the pinpoint accuracy of high-end models like those from Razer or Logitech.</p>\n<p>A standout feature is the rapid-fire button, which FPS players will appreciate for quick multi-click actions.

The inclusion of <strong>3.5mm PORON foam, IXPE switch foam, PET sound-dampening layers, and silicone pads</strong> means that Redragon has put serious effort into <strong>reducing hollow sounds and improving acoustics</strong>‚Äîsomething many budget keyboards fail to address.</p>\n<p>Simply put, this is a <strong>keyboard that feels much more premium than its price suggests.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"typing-experience-smooth-and-satisfying\"><a href=\"#typing-experience-smooth-and-satisfying\" class=\"heading-anchor\"><strong>Typing Experience ‚Äì Smooth and Satisfying</strong></a></h2>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fredrago_behemoth_keycaps.jpg&amp;width=650&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform 650w\" sizes=\"auto\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fredrago_behemoth_keycaps.jpg&amp;width=650&amp;format=jpeg&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"Close-up of Keycaps and Switches\" width=\"650\" height=\"598\"></picture></p>\n</div>\n<p>Redragon has opted for their own <strong>Mint Mambo linear switches</strong>, which come <strong>pre-lubed from the factory.</strong> These switches feel incredibly smooth right out of the box, avoiding the scratchiness that often plagues budget mechanical keyboards. If you‚Äôre into customization, you‚Äôll be happy to know that the keyboard features <strong>hot-swappable sockets</strong> (compatible with <strong>both 3-pin and 5-pin switches</strong>), making it easy to swap in your favorite switches without any soldering.</p>\n<p>Stabilizers are another area where budget keyboards often struggle, but <strong>Redragon has done a commendable job here.</strong> The stabilizers are well-lubed, reducing any annoying rattle on larger keys like the <strong>spacebar, enter, and shift keys.</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you‚Äôre typing up documents, coding, or gaming, the <strong>Behemoth K724 Pro delivers a satisfying, thocky, and well-balanced typing experience.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"connectivity-and-features-where-the-k724-pro-shines\"><a href=\"#connectivity-and-features-where-the-k724-pro-shines\" class=\"heading-anchor\"><strong>Connectivity and Features ‚Äì Where the K724 Pro Shines</strong></a></h2>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fredrago_behemoth_power.jpg&amp;width=493&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform 493w\" sizes=\"auto\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fredrago_behemoth_power.jpg&amp;width=493&amp;format=jpeg&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"Tri-Mode Connectivity Showcase\" width=\"493\" height=\"493\"></picture></p>\n</div>\n<p>If you‚Äôre looking for <strong>versatility</strong>, the K724 Pro delivers in spades.

I had customized a little by using <a href=\"https://fishshell.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">fish shell</a> and <a href=\"https://brew.sh\" rel=\"noopener\">homebrew</a>. I was content with it, it fit my needs and worked. Although, like any tech nerd, I came across a new terminal emulator on Mastodon called <a href=\"https://ghostty.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Ghostty</a>. I took a look at and bookmarked it but that was about it. It‚Äôs hard for me to move to something new, especially something like a terminal app that I use almost daily.</p>\n<p>Last week though I had to completely wipe and reinstall macOS on my MacBook Pro. I‚Äôll spare you the long store, but this gave me the opportunity to start fresh with a new terminal app so I decided to move over to Ghostty.</p>\n<p>Now that I have my terminal env setup using Ghostty with the fish shell, I am noticing the speed difference is definitely faster.

Whether they make us laugh, cry, or see the world differently, certain shows leave a lasting impact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here are my answers to the latest Blog Questions Challenge, TV Edition!</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-what-tv-character-from-a-beloved-show-do-you-wish-you-could-be-best-friends-with-in-real-life\"><a href=\"#1-what-tv-character-from-a-beloved-show-do-you-wish-you-could-be-best-friends-with-in-real-life\" class=\"heading-anchor\">1. What TV Character From A Beloved Show Do You Wish You Could Be Best Friends With In Real Life?</a></h2>\n<p>If I had the chance to be best friends with any TV character, I‚Äôd choose John Dutton from <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4236770/\" rel=\"noopener\">Yellowstone</a>. On the surface, John is a hardened rancher, a man who‚Äôs spent his life protecting his family‚Äôs land and legacy against powerful outside forces. But beneath that tough exterior lies a man of profound wisdom, loyalty, and integrity.</p>\n<p>John is the kind of friend who would always have your back, no matter the odds. He‚Äôs someone who values honesty and respect, and while he may not be the most openly affectionate person, his actions always speak louder than words. A friendship with him would mean gaining an unwavering supporter, someone who would give you the hard truths when necessary but also guide you with wisdom earned from a lifetime of struggle.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, John‚Äôs deep connection to nature and the land is something I deeply admire. Spending time at the Yellowstone Ranch, riding horses at sunrise, and learning life lessons from a man who has seen it all‚Äîthat would be an incredible experience. The loyalty he shows to his family and close friends is something truly rare, and I would be honored to have a friendship like that in real life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-if-you-could-binge-watch-an-entire-series-again-for-the-first-time-which-one-would-you-choose-and-why\"><a href=\"#2-if-you-could-binge-watch-an-entire-series-again-for-the-first-time-which-one-would-you-choose-and-why\" class=\"heading-anchor\">2. If You Could Binge-Watch An Entire Series Again For The First Time, Which One Would You Choose And Why?</a></h2>\n<p>If I could wipe my memory and experience a show for the first time all over again, it would be The <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/\" rel=\"noopener\">Big Bang Theory</a>. This show brought so much joy, laughter, and even unexpected heartfelt moments that I‚Äôd love to relive it with fresh eyes.</p>\n<p>One of the best things about The Big Bang Theory is its balance of humor and character development. At first, it‚Äôs just a quirky sitcom about a group of socially awkward scientists, but over time, the characters grow in ways that make you feel truly invested in their journeys. Watching Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, Raj, and Penny evolve over the seasons was such a fun experience, and I‚Äôd love to go through it all again, not knowing what‚Äôs coming next.</p>\n<p>Plus, the show is packed with so many clever jokes and pop culture references that rewatching it for the first time would allow me to rediscover all those little details that made it so great. There‚Äôs something special about watching a show that makes you laugh out loud, feel for the characters, and escape into a world of friendship and nerdy fun. If I could have that first-time experience again, I absolutely would.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-name-a-tv-show-that-changed-your-perspective-on-the-world-or-taught-you-something-valuable\"><a href=\"#3-name-a-tv-show-that-changed-your-perspective-on-the-world-or-taught-you-something-valuable\" class=\"heading-anchor\">3. Name A TV Show That Changed Your Perspective On The World Or Taught You Something Valuable.</a></h2>\n<p>For me, the TV show that left the biggest impact on my perspective was <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5555260/\" rel=\"noopener\">This Is Us</a>. More than just a drama, this series is a deeply moving exploration of life, love, loss, and the invisible threads that connect us all.</p>\n<p>The show follows the Pearson family across different generations, weaving together past and present in a way that highlights how the choices we make‚Äîand the experiences we endure‚Äîshape who we become. What I love most about This Is Us is its raw honesty. It doesn‚Äôt shy away from the difficult moments‚Äîgrief, addiction, trauma, and mental health struggles‚Äîbut it also reminds us of the beauty in everyday life: a father‚Äôs love for his children, the strength of a marriage, the importance of self-discovery, and the way small moments can define an entire lifetime.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest lessons This Is Us taught me is the power of empathy. It showed that everyone is fighting battles we don‚Äôt always see, and that understanding someone‚Äôs past can give us greater compassion for who they are today. It also reinforced the importance of family, whether by blood or by choice, and how love endures even through the hardest of times.</p>\n<p>Every episode left me reflecting on my own relationships and experiences, making me more appreciative of the moments I have with the people I love. It‚Äôs rare for a TV show to make such a lasting emotional impact, but This Is Us did just that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Final Thoughts</a></h3>\n<p>TV shows aren‚Äôt just entertainment‚Äîthey have the power to inspire, teach, and shape our perspectives.

The arrival of our first computer, running <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95\" rel=\"noopener\">Windows 95</a>, was a pivotal moment. I spent countless hours exploring its capabilities, from playing educational games like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(series)\" rel=\"noopener\">Oregon Trail</a> to navigating the early days of the internet. The thrill of discovery and the endless possibilities that technology offered captivated me from the start.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-your-favorite-piece-of-technology-all-time\"><a href=\"#whats-your-favorite-piece-of-technology-all-time\" class=\"heading-anchor\">What‚Äôs Your Favorite Piece Of Technology All-Time?</a></h3>\n<p>Reflecting on the technological advancements over the years, the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Treo\" rel=\"noopener\">Palm Treo</a></strong> stands out as my all-time favorite. Long before the dominance of modern smartphones, the Palm Treo was a game-changer. It combined a mobile phone with a personal digital assistant (PDA), giving users access to email, contacts, and even rudimentary web browsing on the go. With its full QWERTY keyboard and touchscreen functionality, it set the stage for the mobile revolution that followed. It was one of the earliest devices that truly blended productivity and communication into a single device, making it an essential tool for tech enthusiasts and professionals alike.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-your-favorite-piece-of-technology-right-now\"><a href=\"#whats-your-favorite-piece-of-technology-right-now\" class=\"heading-anchor\">What‚Äôs Your Favorite Piece Of Technology Right Now?</a></h3>\n<p>Currently, I‚Äôm particularly impressed by <strong>e-ink displays and e-readers</strong>, like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/kindle-scribe\" rel=\"noopener\">Kindle Scribe</a> and the <a href=\"https://remarkable.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Remarkable tablet</a>. The ability to mimic the feel of paper while providing digital convenience has transformed reading and note-taking. Unlike traditional screens, e-ink displays are easier on the eyes, energy-efficient, and offer an immersive reading experience without distractions. Whether it‚Äôs for reading books, annotating documents, or taking handwritten notes, this technology continues to evolve in exciting ways.</p>\n<h3 id=\"name-one-new-cool-piece-of-technology-well-have-in-25-years\"><a href=\"#name-one-new-cool-piece-of-technology-well-have-in-25-years\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Name One New Cool Piece Of Technology We‚Äôll Have In 25 Years!</a></h3>\n<p>Looking ahead 25 years, I envision the emergence of fully immersive virtual reality (VR) environments that seamlessly integrate with our daily lives. The foundations of this transformation were laid by <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/realitylabs/\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta</a> with their investment in VR through the Oculus line, but now, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple</a> is spearheading innovation with the <strong>Apple Vision Pro</strong>. This marks a shift toward mixed-reality experiences that blend digital content with the physical world. In the future, I see VR evolving beyond entertainment into virtual workspaces, immersive education, and even fully digital urban landscapes where people can interact in ways that feel as natural as in-person meetings. The fusion of VR with advancements in haptic feedback, artificial intelligence, and ultra-high-resolution displays will redefine how we engage with technology in our everyday lives.</p>\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Final Thoughts</a></h3>\n<p>Technology has been a constant companion throughout my life, evolving from the bulky desktops of the past to the sleek, powerful devices we use today. It‚Äôs a field that never ceases to amaze me with its rapid advancements and the profound impact it has on society. As I continue my journey, personally and professionally, I remain excited about the innovations on the horizon and their potential to transform our world.</p>\n<p>Tagging <a href=\"https://tekphloyd.com/pages/blog\" rel=\"noopener\">@tekphloyd</a>, <a href=\"https://louplummer.lol/blog/\" rel=\"noopener\">Lou</a>, and <a href=\"https://basic.bearblog.dev/\" rel=\"noopener\">Jon</a> it‚Äôs your turn!</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>In IT environments, regular system reboots are essential for maintaining performance, applying security updates, and ensuring overall system stability.</p>\n<p>This is a challenge I‚Äôve encountered recently. In our client‚Äôs environments, some users shut down their endpoints, preventing scheduled restarts from executing through our MSP software. Recently, I needed to update our backup software to a newer version, which required uninstalling the older version and installing the latest one. Since a full removal requires a reboot, I needed a way to remotely ensure this process was completed professionally while minimizing disruption to the user. However, users often delay reboots, leading to performance issues and potential security risks. To solve this, I created a PowerShell script that automatically reminds users to reboot while still allowing flexibility before enforcing a system restart.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-this-script-is-useful\"><a href=\"#why-this-script-is-useful\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Why This Script Is Useful</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automated Reboot Reminders</strong> ‚Äì Users get notified every 10 minutes to reboot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User-Friendly Prompts</strong> ‚Äì Users can choose to delay the reboot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Final Forced Reboot</strong> ‚Äì If they ignore the reminders, the system enforces a reboot after one hour.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Silent Deployment</strong> ‚Äì IT admins can push this script remotely using SCCM, Intune, or PDQ Deploy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-the-script-works\"><a href=\"#how-the-script-works\" class=\"heading-anchor\">How the Script Works</a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Checks if a user is logged in:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If no user is logged in, the system reboots immediately (after a 60-second warning).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a user is present, they receive a reboot prompt every 10 minutes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provides an option to delay the reboot:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Users can click ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to reboot immediately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If they choose ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the script waits 10 minutes before prompting again.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Forces a reboot after 1 hour:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A final warning message informs the user that a reboot is unavoidable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A 30-second countdown begins before the system reboots.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"the-powershell-script\"><a href=\"#the-powershell-script\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The PowerShell Script</a></h2>\n<p>Here‚Äôs the full script:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-powershell\"><code class=\"language-powershell\"><span class=\"token comment\"># Load Windows Forms &amp; Drawing for UI elements</span>\n<span class=\"token namespace\">[void]</span><span class=\"token namespace\">[System.Reflection.Assembly]</span>::LoadWithPartialName<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"System.Windows.Forms\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token namespace\">[void]</span><span class=\"token namespace\">[System.Reflection.Assembly]</span>::LoadWithPartialName<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"System.Drawing\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Set timing</span>\n<span class=\"token variable\">$StartTime</span> = <span class=\"token function\">Get-Date</span>\n<span class=\"token variable\">$EndTime</span> = <span class=\"token variable\">$StartTime</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>AddMinutes<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>60<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Check if a user is logged in</span>\n<span class=\"token variable\">$UserLoggedIn</span> = <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token function\">Get-WmiObject</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token keyword\">Class</span> Win32_ComputerSystem<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>UserName\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token operator\">-not</span> <span class=\"token variable\">$UserLoggedIn</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">Write-Host</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"No user is logged in.

Designed as a social browser, Surf combines content from various platforms, offering a customizable, user-focused experience. In this review, I‚Äôll share my insights, highlight its standout features, and explain how you can participate in the experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"first-impressions-what-is-surf\"><a href=\"#first-impressions-what-is-surf\" class=\"heading-anchor\">First Impressions: What is Surf?</a></h2>\n<p>At its core, <a href=\"https://about.surf.social\" rel=\"noopener\">Surf</a> aligns with the vision of the <strong>IndieWeb movement</strong>, which focuses on decentralization and user control over their online presence. By integrating platforms like Mastodon, Bluesky (coming soon), Threads, RSS feeds, podcasts, and YouTube, Surf empowers users to take control of their digital experience.</p>\n<p>This philosophy resonates with what Mike discusses in his post, <a href=\"https://shellsharks.com/notes/2025/01/22/surfing-the-social-web\" rel=\"noopener\">‚ÄúSurfing the Social Web‚Äù</a>. Surf goes beyond simply aggregating content; it embodies a mission to promote autonomy and create a seamless browsing experience in a fragmented online world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"key-features-of-surf\"><a href=\"#key-features-of-surf\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Key Features of Surf</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-customizable-feeds\"><a href=\"#1-customizable-feeds\" class=\"heading-anchor\">1. Customizable Feeds</a></h3>\n<p>One of Surf‚Äôs most powerful features is its <strong>feed customization</strong>. You can pull content from your favorite sources and organize them into unique feeds tailored to your interests. Whether it‚Äôs tech news, photography, or AI advancements, Surf gives you the tools to curate content that matters most to you.</p>\n<p>This customization highlights the importance of enhancing user engagement. By empowering the user to control the experience, Surf ensures that users see what they want, how they want it, and when they want it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-nested-feeds-for-deeper-organization\"><a href=\"#2-nested-feeds-for-deeper-organization\" class=\"heading-anchor\">2. Nested Feeds for Deeper Organization</a></h3>\n<p>For those who love structure, Surf introduces <strong>nested feeds</strong>. Think of it as a hierarchy for your content. You can create a primary feed for technology and add sub-feeds for specific topics like coding tutorials or gadget reviews.</p>\n<p>This level of organization makes browsing easier and reflects Surf‚Äôs commitment to helping users manage information overload effectively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-seamless-mastodon-integration\"><a href=\"#3-seamless-mastodon-integration\" class=\"heading-anchor\">3. Seamless Mastodon Integration</a></h3>\n<p>Surf is designed with the open social web in mind, and its <strong>Mastodon integration</strong> is a perfect example. You can follow accounts, interact with posts, and even <strong>post directly to Mastodon</strong> from within the app.</p>\n<p>This seamless experience eliminates the need to switch between platforms, streamlining your interactions with decentralized networks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-bluesky-support-on-the-horizon\"><a href=\"#4-bluesky-support-on-the-horizon\" class=\"heading-anchor\">4. Bluesky Support on the Horizon</a></h3>\n<p>During a recent meeting with the Flipboard team, we discussed their roadmap for Surf. One of the most exciting updates is the <strong>upcoming integration of Bluesky accounts</strong>, which will further expand Surf‚Äôs capabilities.</p>\n<p>The meeting was a fantastic opportunity to share feedback and learn more about the team‚Äôs plans. The team is clearly dedicated to building a tool that not only meets but anticipates user needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-a-polished-user-experience\"><a href=\"#5-a-polished-user-experience\" class=\"heading-anchor\">5. A Polished User Experience</a></h3>\n<p>Surf combines functionality with a sleek, user-friendly design. Whether you‚Äôre reading an article, watching a video, or listening to a podcast, the app delivers a smooth and visually engaging experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-sign-up-for-surf\"><a href=\"#how-to-sign-up-for-surf\" class=\"heading-anchor\">How to Sign Up for Surf</a></h2>\n<p>Ready to explore Surf for yourself?

Its ability to integrate platforms, customize feeds, and align with IndieWeb principles makes it a standout choice for those who value control and personalization in their online experience.</p>\n<p>With features like nested feeds and Mastodon integration already in place‚Äîand Bluesky support on the way‚ÄîSurf is positioned to become an essential part of your digital toolkit.</p>\n<p>Don‚Äôt wait to experience it for yourself‚Äîsign up, grab an invite code, and start surfing the social web in a whole new way!</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-your-take\"><a href=\"#whats-your-take\" class=\"heading-anchor\">What‚Äôs Your Take?</a></h3>\n<p>Have you tried Surf yet, or are you considering it?

However, all those have been lost to history and mainly consisted of random thoughts on tech, etc. I guess, the reason I started blogging was everyone else was and I wanted to get ‚Äúmy name‚Äù out there also.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-platform-are-you-using-to-manage-your-blog-and-why-do-you-use-it\"><a href=\"#what-platform-are-you-using-to-manage-your-blog-and-why-do-you-use-it\" class=\"heading-anchor\">What platform are you using to manage your blog, and why do you use it?</a></h2>\n<p>When I recently got back into blogging, about a couple of years ago, I used <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Jekyll</a> housed on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub Pages</a>. The developer in me loved using Jekyll and building out my blog posts in markdown and then pushing them to GH for publishing. I know pretty geeky.</p>\n<p>Now, though, I have moved over to <a href=\"https://adam.omg.lol/\" rel=\"noopener\">Adam‚Äôs</a> <a href=\"https://weblog.lol\" rel=\"noopener\">weblog.lol</a> blogging platform that is part of <a href=\"https://omg.lol\" rel=\"noopener\">OMG.lol</a>. Since I have most of my stuff on OMG, it was just easier to have my blog there and keep everything in one place. Plus, it is easy to use and have markdown capability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"have-you-blogged-on-other-platforms-before\"><a href=\"#have-you-blogged-on-other-platforms-before\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Have you blogged on other platforms before?</a></h2>\n<p>I have been on and tested out way too many blogging platforms to count, some of which never even made the cut to be my main platform.</p>\n<p>If my memory serves me correctly, this goes back 20-some years now; I started writing on my MySpace page. Just writing down short things, thoughts, etc. Then as I started to become more serious with blogging, like most others, I used WordPress.</p>\n<p>More recently, as mentioned above, I used Jekyll. There shortly, I tried <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev\" rel=\"noopener\">Eleventy</a>, <a href=\"https://scribbles.page/\" rel=\"noopener\">Scribbles</a>, and <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\" rel=\"noopener\">Hugo</a> but neither of them stuck.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-you-write-your-posts\"><a href=\"#how-do-you-write-your-posts\" class=\"heading-anchor\">How do you write your posts?</a></h2>\n<p>Most of the time I use <a href=\"https://www.ulysses.app\" rel=\"noopener\">Ulysses</a> to draft up my posts. I <strong>love markdown</strong> so using Ulysses, being able to write them up in markdown is simple, and then I can just copy and paste them into the web editor of weblog. Sometimes though, I live on the wild side and just write them directly in the web editor of weblog. The only problem with that is that, weblog doesn‚Äôt have a save as draft, it is only publish.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-do-you-feel-most-inspired-to-write\"><a href=\"#when-do-you-feel-most-inspired-to-write\" class=\"heading-anchor\">When do you feel most inspired to write?</a></h2>\n<p>I‚Äôve never been a great or even a good writer. I struggle to come up with words or subjects to write about. So, if I write a blog post, it is usually when I have some kind of personal thing to talk about, some technology came out that I have a take on, something regarding my field of work, etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"do-you-normally-publish-immediately-after-writing-or-do-you-let-it-simmer-a-bit\"><a href=\"#do-you-normally-publish-immediately-after-writing-or-do-you-let-it-simmer-a-bit\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Do you normally publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit?</a></h2>\n<p>Most of my posts are written and then posted immediately afterward. I don‚Äôt have a lot of free time, I‚Äôm afraid that if I write a post and let it sit, I will forget about it completely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-your-favorite-post-on-your-blog\"><a href=\"#whats-your-favorite-post-on-your-blog\" class=\"heading-anchor\">What‚Äôs your favorite post on your blog?</a></h2>\n<p>What is it with everyone and the ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù question? üòÉ</p>\n<p>This is a difficult question to answer. When I moved my blog from Jekyll to Weblog, I elected to not move over those posts and start fresh. So I guess the favorite one out of the posts on Weblog would be <a href=\"https://weblog.kylereddoch.me/2024/09/the-iphone-wall-project\" rel=\"noopener\">The iPhone Wall Project</a>as it is something dear to me. I am trying to get an iPhone wall started in my office. I haven‚Äôt had much luck/traction yet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"any-future-plans-for-the-blog\"><a href=\"#any-future-plans-for-the-blog\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Any future plans for the blog?</a></h2>\n<p>I have done quite a lot of work on weblog to customize it and extend it far beyond what it was meant to be. For now, I am pretty happy where I am, both design-wise and service-wise. Although Adam is working on a brand-new, powerful, feature-rich blogging platform named <a href=\"https://neato.pub\" rel=\"noopener\">Neato</a> that I will move to when it is ready.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-will-participate-next\"><a href=\"#who-will-participate-next\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Who will participate next?</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://rknight.me\" rel=\"noopener\">Robb</a> and <a href=\"https://gabz.blog\" rel=\"noopener\">Gabz</a>‚Ä¶TAG, you‚Äôre next!!</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>I first signed up for Mastodon back in 2018 on mastodon.social but after that, really never did anything with it. I was more active on Twitter like most other people. But, as Twitter started to decline after <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/11/23019836/elon-musk-twitter-board-of-directors-news-updates\" rel=\"noopener\">Elon bought it</a>, I decided to give Mastodon another look. I moved around different instances at first but then finally found a home on <a href=\"https://allthingstech.social\" rel=\"noopener\">allthingstech.social</a> where I am a co-admin along with <a href=\"https://allthingstech.social@cliffwade\" rel=\"noopener\">@cliffwade</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-mastodon-ui\"><a href=\"#the-mastodon-ui\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Mastodon UI</a></h2>\n<p>After I moved to Mastodon, I started to feel like this was the place to be. People were welcoming, conversations were more engaging. Even though my following numbers were nowhere near those I had on Twitter, it felt like the quality here on Mastodon was way better. I felt something was off though. The Mastodon UI is good, but the Twitter UI‚Äôs aesthetics were just <strong>beautiful and felt ‚Äúmodern‚Äù</strong>. I am not saying that Mastodon should be just like Twitter, be let‚Äôs face it, Mastodon‚Äôs UI could use a bit of an upgrade.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enter-birdui\"><a href=\"#enter-birdui\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Enter BirdUI</a></h2>\n<p>Coming from a web development background, I thought about tweaking the UI of Mastodon to allow for my own aesthetic liking. Unfortunately, my schedule doesn‚Äôt have that much extra wiggle room for the amount of time it would take.</p>\n<p>Gratefully, <a href=\"https://mementomori.social/@rolle\" rel=\"noopener\">Rolle</a> spent the time to create the <em>exact thing</em>. His <a href=\"https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/mastodon-bird-ui\" rel=\"noopener\">Mastodon BirdUI</a> is inspired by the aesthetics and beauty of the Twitter UI but made for Mastodon. It is everything I was asking for!</p>\n<p>I have been using Rolle‚Äôs BirdUI ever since he released it. I use Mastodon in a multi-column view on the web. If you use his multi-column layout, you know that the compose section is on the right. Now, coming from Twitter and using Tweetdeck for so many years, I am used to the compose section being on the left, and honestly, it just makes sense.</p>\n<p>I edited BirdUI to shift the compose section to the left and make the columns a little narrower.

I <strong><em>fell in love</em></strong> with his wall of all those iPhone boxes the first time I saw it in one of his videos. That nostalgia just hit me!</p>\n<p>So now, I am getting around to starting my own iPhone wall. I‚Äôm not sure how I am going to lay it out just yet as my skills as an interior decorator aren‚Äôt near as good as that of a tech person.

In return, I will be making a post of me putting the phone box on the wall in its position and shouting out the person who sent it on my <a href=\"https://profiles.kylereddoch.me\" rel=\"noopener\">socials</a>.

      "content_html": "<p>Ever since Elon took over the helm of Twitter and causing quite an uproar, people have been flocking to Mastodon as their new social media platform. Mastdodon isn‚Äôt showing any signs of going anywhere anytime soon, so it will be here for a long time. With this change, people have been looking for a way that would allow their readers to share their content to Mastodon, myself included.</p>\n<p>Mastodon, though, is different than Twitter in that it is a decentralized network. This means that the mechanics of creating a share button is a <em>little</em> bit more complicated than just using a URL (you need to know <em>where</em> to send the user).</p>\n<p>In this post, I will show you how I created a Mastodon share button for this website using a little bit of HTML and Javascript.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-challenge\"><a href=\"#the-challenge\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Challenge</a></h2>\n<p>Per the <a href=\"https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/statuses/\" rel=\"noopener\">Mastodon documentation</a>, we need to send the button to the following URL <code>/share</code> url on the users Mastodon instance, but we don‚Äôt know what instance the user is on; this could be anything from <code>iosdev.space</code> to <code>mastodon.social</code>. At this time, there is no way to automatically determine the users instance, at least not that I know of.</p>\n<p>We can accomplish this by using a little bit of Javascript (with a <code>click</code> event) to prompt the user for their instance (via Javascript‚Äôs <code>prompt()</code>) and then open a window onto the share page that prepopulates both the post title and URL of your article (these are editable by the user to whatever they what to post).</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-javascript\"><a href=\"#the-javascript\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Javascript</a></h3>\n<p>For the Javascript, we will need to create a function that will prompt the user for their instance and then open a new window with the share URL. We will also need to add a <code>click</code> event to the button that will call this function.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token comment\">/* Generate a share link for the user's Mastodon domain */</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">MastodonShare</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">e</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// Gather the source text and URL</span>\n    src <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> e<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>target<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getAttribute</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"data-src\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// Gather the Mastodon domain</span>\n    domain <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">prompt</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Enter your Mastodon domain\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"mastodon.social\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>domain <span class=\"token operator\">==</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">||</span> domain <span class=\"token operator\">==</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">null</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// Build the URL</span>\n    url <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> domain <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"/share?text=\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> src<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// Open a window on the share page</span>\n    window<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">open</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>url<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'_blank'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://donate.stripe.com/3cs7voeE46LX07e7ss\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button\">Support this site with a cup of coffee</a></div>\n<h3 id=\"the-html\"><a href=\"#the-html\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The HTML</a></h3>\n<p>For the HTML, we will need to create a button that will call the function when clicked (the <code>onclick</code> attribute).

      "content_html": "<p>If you are like myself and many other Birdsite users of past, you have began flocking to <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org\" rel=\"noopener\">Mastodon</a> and making yourself a home there. Mastodon although is different than most mainstream social media platforms. It is a federated network, meaning that there are many different instances of Mastodon that are all connected to each other. This means that you can <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/servers\" rel=\"noopener\">choose which instance</a> you want to use and you can even <a href=\"https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/run-your-own/\" rel=\"noopener\">create your own instance</a> if you want to. This is great because it means that you can choose an instance that you like and that you feel comfortable with.</p>\n<p>So you decided to choose an instance you liked and created an account. In my case, I chose to use <a href=\"https://iosdev.space\" rel=\"noopener\">iosdev.space</a> as my instance and my username is kylewritescode. Therefore, my full Mastodon account is <a href=\"https://iosdev.space/@kylewritescode\" rel=\"noopener\">@kylewritescode@iosdev.space</a>.</p>\n<p>What if you wanted to add a little more personalization to your username? What if you wanted to use a domain you already have without having to struggle with hosting an entire Mastodon server? With this personalization, it means that no matter what instance you use, or what instance you decide to use in the future, you will always be able to share the same username and have it pointed to your account.</p>\n<p>Here is how I did it using GitHub Pages. Although, this can be done using any hosting service that allows you to create a .named folder.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-webfinger\"><a href=\"#using-webfinger\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Using WebFinger</a></h2>\n<p>Mastodon uses <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/how-to-implement-a-basic-activitypub-server/\" rel=\"noopener\">ActivityPub</a> to communication with ‚Äúactors‚Äù and those actors are found using WebFinger, a way to attach information to a specific email address or other online resource. So, to get my personalized username to work, I just needed to create a WebFinger spec on my domain.</p>\n<p><code>&lt;yourinstaceaddress&gt;/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:&lt;yourusername&gt;@&lt;yourinstaceaddress&gt;</code></p>\n<p>So, if I wanted to get information about my account on iosdev.space, I would go to:</p>\n<p><code>https://iosdev.space/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:kylewritescode@iosdev.space</code></p>\n<p>That means, when I go to that endpoint, I get a JSON response that looks like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"subject\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"acct:kylewritescode@iosdev.space\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"aliases\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"token string\">\"https://iosdev.space/@kylewritescode\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token string\">\"https://iosdev.space/users/kylewritescode\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"links\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"rel\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"type\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"text/html\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"href\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://iosdev.space/@kylewritescode\"</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"rel\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"self\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"type\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"application/activity+json\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"href\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://iosdev.space/users/kylewritescode\"</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"rel\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"http://ostatus.org/schema/1.0/subscribe\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"template\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://iosdev.space/authorize_interaction?uri={uri}\"</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>Now all I need to do is put that JSON reponse in the same directory and file and that‚Äôs it!</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://donate.stripe.com/3cs7voeE46LX07e7ss\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button\">Support this site with a cup of coffee</a></div>\n<h2 id=\"creating-the-webfinger-spec-with-jekyll\"><a href=\"#creating-the-webfinger-spec-with-jekyll\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Creating the WebFinger Spec with Jekyll</a></h2>\n<p>My blog runs on <code>Jekyll</code> and is hosted on <code>GitHub Pages</code>.

      "content_html": "<p>With the crashing and burning happening at Twitter, I have made the personal decision to leave the platform that I have loved and enjoyed for the past 14 years. I have enjoyed great conversations, connections, and even learned in that timespan. but seeing how things are spawning out of control, I have decided to move to a platform that I have been wanting to learn for a while now. I have decided to move to <a href=\"https://iosdev.space/@kylewritescode\" rel=\"noopener\">Mastodon</a>.</p>\n<p>Now I have had a Mastodon account ever since 2016 but haven‚Äôt used it until just a few days ago. Once I started using it, I realized that I really like the platform. It is a great alternative to Twitter and I am excited to learn more about it. I was off to the races. I have since learned quite a bit about the platform and have been enjoying it. I have also been enjoying the conversations I have been having with people on the platform. Somehow, I have been having more meaningful conversations on Mastodon than I have on Twitter. I have also moved (more about that in another post) to <a href=\"https://iosdev.space\" rel=\"noopener\">iosdev.space</a> which is a great instance to be on if you‚Äôrer interested in iOS or Swift development.</p>\n<p>Well, since I have falling in love with Mastodon, it has gotten me intrigued with the idea of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse\" rel=\"noopener\">Fediverse</a> as a whole and I am 100% going down the rabbit hole. I am finding decentralized alternatives to centralized apps and services that I use on a daily basis. Because of that, I have decided to move my blogs commenting system away from disqus and over to Mastodon. The migrating is now complete and I am excited to share how I did it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"modifications-made-to-jekyll\"><a href=\"#modifications-made-to-jekyll\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Modifications made to Jekyll</a></h2>\n<p>There were two modifications that needed to be made to my Jekyll instance to get this working. First, I had to create a new html file. I named it <code>fediverse_comments.html</code> (you can name it whatever you like) and placed it in the <code>_includes</code> folder. Here‚Äôs what that file looks like.</p>\n<h3 id=\"_includes\\fediverse_commentshtml\"><a href=\"#_includes\\fediverse_commentshtml\" class=\"heading-anchor\">_includes\\fediverse_comments.html</a></h3>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/kylereddoch/dabd00a4baa97ffa36ae40af4b91fd59.js\"></script>\n<p>Second I needed to change the exising <code>post.html</code> file located in the <code>_layouts</code> folder. I added the following code which will tell Jekyll to use the <code>fediverse_comments.html</code> file when it is rendering the post if the <code>comments</code> variable is set in the front matter of the post (more on that in a bit).</p>\n<p>You can add this code anywhere in the <code>post.html</code> file. I added it at the bottom of the file since I wanted the comments to be at the bottom of the post.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/kylereddoch/bafea27fd3ae9f0fd49b83a0c6f24118.js\"></script>\n<h3 id=\"_layouts\\posthtml\"><a href=\"#_layouts\\posthtml\" class=\"heading-anchor\">_layouts\\post.html</a></h3>\n<p>Here is what my <code>post.html</code> file looks like.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/kylereddoch/509fe375a32a514708e30a97fc89ff8a.js\"></script>\n<h2 id=\"enabling-comments-on-a-post\"><a href=\"#enabling-comments-on-a-post\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Enabling Comments on a Post</a></h2>\n<p>Now that we have the code in place to render the comments we need to tell Jekyll to render the comments on a post. To do this we need to add the <code>comments</code> variable to the front matter of the post.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-yaml\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">comments</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">host</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> iosdev.space\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">username</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> kylewritescode\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">id</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">109325166591243911</span></code></pre>\n<p>Before that though, you will need to first create a post on Mastodon for the article (meaning you will have to come back and edit the post with the id) that you will be creating comments for. This is because the comments are tied to the post on Mastodon. After that post is created you will need to get the ID of the post. You can get the ID by going to the post on Mastodon and looking at the URL. The ID will be the number at the end of the URL. For example, if the URL is <code>https://iosdev.space/@kylewritescode/106000000000000000</code> the ID is <code>106000000000000000</code>. Once you have the ID you can add the <code>comments</code> variable to the front matter of the post.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of what the front matter of a post would look like.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-yaml\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">comments</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">host</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> iosdev.space\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">username</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> kylewritescode \n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">id</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">109325166591243911</span>  </code></pre>\n<p>Host is the domain of the instance you want to pull comments from (the instance you‚Äôre on). Username is the username of the user who created the post (you). Id is the id of the post. You can find the id of the post by going to the post on the instance and looking at the url. The id is the number at the end of the url.</p>\n<p>And that is all! You should now have comments on your Jekyll site using Mastodon. If you have any questions or comments feel free to reach out to me on Mastodon <a href=\"https://iosdev.space/@kylewritescode\" rel=\"noopener\">@kylewritecode@iosdev.space</a>.</p>\n",

      "title": "Tutorial: Pseudocode and Flowcharts for Coding",
      "content_html": "<p>As you work on a coding project, especially one that is more complex, it starts to become important to plan or ‚Äúdesign‚Äù out your code before actually writing it. Desinging your code helps you organize the logic and keep track of the various possibilities that your project needs to handle. There are two tools that I use (well programmers in general usually do) to help me plan out my code. Those tools are pseudocode and flowcharts.</p>\n<p>The following is an assignment I had to do for my Python scripting class that included pseudocode and a flowchart. Let‚Äôs get into it so you can see an example of both.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\"><a href=\"#the-problem\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Problem</a></h2>\n<p>A company wants a program that will calculate the weekly paycheck for an employee based on how many hours they worked. For this company, an employee earns $20 an hour for the first 40 hours that they work. The employee earns overtime, $30 an hour, for each hour they work above 40 hours.</p>\n<p>So, let‚Äôs start with the pseudocode first.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pseudocode\"><a href=\"#pseudocode\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Pseudocode</a></h3>\n<p><strong>What is pseudocode in the first place?</strong></p>\n<p>Pseudocode is an intermediary step between reading a problem statement and writing the code to solve the problem. It serves as a blueprint for your program to guide you through, just like contractors start with a blueprint before building a house. Use your pseudocode as a tool to begin thinking about your program, but keep in mind it might not be the final solution to the problem. Pseudocode is written in a natural language using some programming keywords.</p>\n<p>Now back to the problem above. Let‚Äôs get the pseudocode written as the first step to designing our code.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">INPUT number of hours worked\nDECLARE weekly pay, overtime pay, and overtime hours as variables\nIF the number of hours worked is &lt;= 40:\n    THEN weekly pay = number of hours worked * 20;\nELSE:\n    Overtime hours = number of hours worked ‚Äì 40;\n    Overtime pay = overtime hours * 30;\n    Weekly pay = (40 * 20) + overtime pay;\nPRINT weekly paycheck amount</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, we are using some programming words like INPUT, IF, and ELSE but are still using natural language to walk through the steps of the program. There is also proper indention where it would be placed in the code.</p>\n<p>Now onto the flowchart‚Ä¶</p>\n<h3 id=\"flowcharts\"><a href=\"#flowcharts\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Flowcharts</a></h3>\n<p><strong>What is a flowchart?</strong></p>\n<p>A flowchart is a diagram that depicts a process, system or computer algorithm. They are widely used in multiple fields to document, study, plan, improve and communicate often complex processes in clear, easy-to-understand diagrams. Flowcharts use rectangles, ovals, diamonds and potentially numerous other shapes to define the type of step, along with connecting arrows to define flow and sequence. They can range from simple, hand-drawn charts to comprehensive computer-drawn diagrams depicting multiple steps and routes.</p>\n<p>Now back to our problem. How are we going to create a flowchart to define the steps and sequences our program needs to take?</p>\n<p>Well there are a few different ways you can create a flowchart. One way is you can use Microsoft Word and the add shapes feature. Another option is to use Microsoft Powerpoint and built it out there. You can also use Microsoft‚Äôs own diagram software called Visio.</p>\n<p>I though, use <a href=\"https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/\" rel=\"noopener\">Lucidchart by Lucid</a>. It is a simple, drag and drop flowchart creator. You can choose from various different templates or even start from a blank one.</p>\n<p>So, let‚Äôs see how we would flowchart the program. Below is the one that I created using Lucidchart.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fflowchart-weekly-pay-program.svg&amp;width=650&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform 650w, /.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fflowchart-weekly-pay-program.svg&amp;width=960&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform 960w, /.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fflowchart-weekly-pay-program.svg&amp;width=1400&amp;format=webp&amp;via=transform 1400w\" sizes=\"auto\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fflowchart-weekly-pay-program.svg&amp;width=650&amp;format=jpeg&amp;via=transform\" alt=\"Flowchart for Weekly Pay Program Senario\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1991\" srcset=\"/.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fflowchart-weekly-pay-program.svg&amp;width=650&amp;format=jpeg&amp;via=transform 650w, /.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fflowchart-weekly-pay-program.svg&amp;width=960&amp;format=jpeg&amp;via=transform 960w, /.11ty/image/?src=src%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fflowchart-weekly-pay-program.svg&amp;width=1400&amp;format=jpeg&amp;via=transform 1400w\" sizes=\"auto\"></picture></p>\n<p>So there we have it. We have both our pseudocode and flowchart created and now we can start to build out our actual code.</p>\n<p>For me, since this is a Python scripting class, I wrote out the program using Python. Let‚Äôs take a look at how the code would look.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-python-code\"><a href=\"#the-python-code\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Python Code</a></h3>\n<pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"token triple-quoted-string string\">\"\"\"\nProblem: A company wants a program that will calculate the weekly paycheck for an employee based on how many hours\nthey worked.

This app fits all my needs and plus, it looks just beautiful.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-forte\"><a href=\"#what-is-forte\" class=\"heading-anchor\">What is Forte?</a></h2>\n<p>What sets this habit tracker apart from all the others out there is, it doesn‚Äôt punish you for having a ‚Äúbad‚Äù day. Forte doesn‚Äôt do streaks. Their motto is, <strong>‚ÄúBuild Habits, Not Streaks.‚Äù</strong> When you have a habt tracker app that works on streaks, you build up those streaks to just one day having them return to zero because you didn‚Äôt do your habit. ICK! Forte, uses a custom algorithm that it runs your habits through and presents your score based on performance. Your score won‚Äôt go down just by missing a day.

      "content_html": "<p>My entire site uses GitHub‚Äôs Pages feature, so therefore everything is version controlled. Using a Git client to update and add new posts, etc., makes it possible from anywhere. So when I went out looking for a Git client that would allow me to do what I needed, I was glad that I came across <a href=\"https://workingcopy.app\" rel=\"noopener\">Working Copy</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-copy-features\"><a href=\"#working-copy-features\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Working Copy Features</a></h2>\n<p>Working Copy prides itself on being a full-featured git client. Its features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clone</li>\n<li>Push</li>\n<li>Pull</li>\n<li>Fetch</li>\n<li>Merge</li>\n<li>Create branches</li>\n<li>plus more</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"working-with-remote-repositories\"><a href=\"#working-with-remote-repositories\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Working with remote repositories</a></h2>\n<p>From the app‚Äôs main screen, you can clone repositories, create new ones, or even start from an iCloud folder you may have. Many of the clients out there only allow you to connect to the popular Git services, but Working Copy allows you to connect to any server you may want to use by using the URL tab.</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-with-your-local-copy\"><a href=\"#working-with-your-local-copy\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Working with your local copy</a></h2>\n<p>Once your files are cloned to your device, you can even work on your files within Working Copy with its built-in editor. The editor is a simple yet powerful one. It supports many languages you may use. You can also change font size, choose from available fronts, show line numbers or not, and even word wrap.</p>\n<h2 id=\"files-app-support\"><a href=\"#files-app-support\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Files app support</a></h2>\n<p>Working Copy also supports iOS‚Äôs Files app if all the above features aren‚Äôt enough. That means you can add Working Copy to the sidebar to access files within it straight from Files. It also supports the Open in place feature, which allows any apps that support Document Picker to work with the files in Working copy without importing them into their own space.</p>\n<h3

I‚Äôm on the go, I can manage my site from any of my devices. I use Working Copy to keep my files in sync with my GitHub repository. Once on my device, whether my iPhone or iPad, I use Ulysses to edit/work on those files.

The pro feature is an in-app subscription; when you buy the Pro unlock, you get all features plus any added within the year. After that, you need to buy an upgrade.</p>\n<p>For me, it is worth it! Finding this app has helped my workflow.</p>\n<p>So, if you are looking for a full-featured git client to use on your iPhone/iPad, I highly recommend <a href=\"https://workingcopy.app\" rel=\"noopener\">Working Copy</a>.</p>\n",

If only someone would frame them so people could hang them up for decor. This is precisely what Grid Studio has done!</p>\n<p>Grid Studio creates incredible, framed wall decorations consisting of Apple devices (and others too - like Gameboys and Samsungs) for us to admire. They put the device in the frame and break it down component by component, including labeling each one. Being able to see the insides of the device shows their beauty. Grid Studio also breaks down the dimensions of each element to add some ‚Äúflair‚Äù to it.</p>\n<p>Grid Studio was generous enough to send me a couple of devices for this review. Grid Studio sent me the iPhone 4S and Apple Watch Series 1. Both of these devices were remarkable when they debuted. I can still remember getting each device for the first time. The iPhone 4S was the 3rd iPhone I owned, and the Series 1 Apple Watch was the first-ever smartwatch I had. Seeing these devices framed brought back so much nostalgia.</p>\n<is-land on:idle>\n  <div role=\"list\" class=\"gallery | grid mt-l-xl gutter-xs\"><dialog class=\"flow modal1\">\n        <div
