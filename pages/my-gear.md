This page is used to list all the gear I use on a regular basis. I've been asked a lot about what I use, so I figured I'd put it all in one place. I'll try to keep this page updated as I can.

Some of the items below have been gifted to me but that doesn't change my opinion of them. I only recommend products that I use and love.

## üè† Home Office Setup

### Desk

While I do not have a standing desk...yet, I do have a desk that isn't too bad and that fits my needs.

**Computer Desk** - [https://amzn.to/3ymTZnR](https://amzn.to/3ymTZnR)

### üñ•Ô∏è Computers and Desktop Setup

I actually run 2 computers throughout the day, 1 Mac mini for development and daily use, and 1 MacBook Pro 14" for development, content creation, video editing, and etc. for when I am on the go or not wanting to be at my desk.

**MacBook Pro 16" M1 Pro** - [https://amzn.to/3yqQNHA](https://amzn.to/3yqQNHA) - My untethered and somtimes tethered best that I can take anywhere and do anything on. I love this thing!

**Mac mini  (2018)** - [https://amzn.to/3yoYFtf](https://amzn.to/3yoYFtf) - This is still the Intel version but I am planning on getting an M1 or M2 version soon. I still use this as my main computer for development and other things. I does struggle a bit with some of the more intensive tasks but it still gets the job done.

**TCL 32" HD Roku TV** - [https://amzn.to/3SZK68W](https://amzn.to/3SZK68W) - I use this as the main monitor for my Mac mini. I also use it as a secondary monitor for my MacBook Pro when I am at my desk.

**Dell 23" IPS LED FHD Monitor** - [https://amzn.to/41UUrqJ](https://amzn.to/41UUrqJ) - I use this as the secondary monitor for my Mac mini. It is also used as a tertiary monitor for my MacBook Pro when I am at my desk.

**Logitech K380 Bluetooth Keyboard** - [https://amzn.to/3mtGboE](https://amzn.to/3mtGboE) - I love this keyboard. It's small, compact, and works great with my Mac mini. I also use it with my iPad Pro when I am on the go.

### üéôÔ∏è Audio Setup

**JLab Talk Go USB Microphone** - [https://amzn.to/3ypqxxp](https://amzn.to/3ypqxxp) - This is the mic that I use for my videos, etc. It's a great mic for the price. I plan on getting an arm for it soon.
