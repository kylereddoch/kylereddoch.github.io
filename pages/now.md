## What's New?

This update is a pretty big one as I have been busy with my personal life these past few months that I haven't updated this page unfortunately. With the craze of the migration off of Twitter and onto another social media platform, mostly Mastodon, I have had the privledge to become an admin of a server along with [Cliff Wade](https://allthingstech.social/@cliffwade). It has been a blast so far and I am enjoying it. We are a small server but we are growing. Our server is called [All Things Tech](https://allthingstech.social) and we are a server for tech enthusiasts but welcome all sorts of people. We are a safe space for everyone. We also setup up both a Wiki, Blog, and Discord for the community. You can find the Wiki [here](https://wiki.allthingstech.social), Blog [here](https://blog.allthingstech.social), and the Discord [here](https://chat.allthingstech.social).

As I use the Fediverse more and more, I find myself loving it that much more. I have started to look into the other services that are part of the Fediverse and are in the process of moving my more centralized social accounts to Fediverse accounts. Account like Goodreads (Bookwyrm), Instragm (Pixelfed), Reddit (Lemmy), and more. What happened in the Twitter debacle really opened my eyes to how centralized social media is and how much control they have over you and your data. I am not saying that the Fediverse is perfect, it has it's own issues, but it is a lot better than the centralized social media platforms.

### Apps I'm Using

**[Mona for Mastodon](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mona-for-mastodon/id1659154653)** - I have been using Mona for awhile now as my go to Mastodon client and I have been absolutely in love it with. It is a beautiful app with a lot of features and customizations. One of those customization that I really love is the ability to customize the theme of the app yourself. You can the most every aspect of the app to your liking. It even has the ability to share your theme with others. I created a AllThingsTech theme based on the colors of our logo for the server. You can find that [mon-cat://37a9](mon-cat://37a9). I highly recommend this app if you are looking for a Mastodon client.

**[Book Tracker](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1491660771)** - I am trying to get myself back into reading more and I have been using Book Tracker to help me track my reading. It is developed by indie developers so of course I back it! It is privacy focused and doesn't take any of your data like say Goodreads does. I use this app along with Bookwyrm (for the social aspect) to keep track of my reading and hoping to get back into reading more. Definitely check this app out if you are looking for a privacy focused book tracker.

**[Waterllama](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1454778585)** - I have been off and on with tracking my water intake and have been using Waterminder for the longest time. I have been wanting to move away from it for awhile now and I finally found an app that I finally like. Interestingly though, the app was shown to me by my oldest daughter. Once I saw the app I feel in love. Waterllama is a beautfil app that is simple to use and has a great widget. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I am loving it. I highly recommend this app if you are looking for a water tracking app.

I think that sum's it up for this update of What I'm Up To Right Now. Until next time, cheers üçª.
