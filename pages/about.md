Technology has always been at the core of my life. Ever since I was a young child, I have been fond of technology. There’s just something about tech that opens up new possibilities to a person. Being able to help people learn new technologies brings me joy.

I have gone too long without creating a place to write about technology and continue helping others.

### ⚙️ Shortcuts

[Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) has allowed me to simplify many aspects of my daily life. Now that Shortcuts is available for Mac too, even more applications are possible.
