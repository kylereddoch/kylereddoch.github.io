Technology has always been at the core of my life. Ever since I was a young child, I have been fond of technology. There‚Äôs just something about tech that opens up new possibilities to a person. Being able to help people learn new technologies brings me joy.

I have gone too long without creating a place to write about technology and continue helping others.

This is my personal blog where I write and post about topics I find exciting and think others will find interesting. I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them.

### ü§î What I'm Up to Right Now

### üßëüèª‚Äçüíª What I Do

I am an aspiring Swift/SwifUI Apple Developer. I have backgorund in front-end development and have dabbled in back-end development. I love to create tools and open-source projects that help make a difference in people's lives.

[Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) has allowed me to simplify many aspects of my daily life. Now that Shortcuts is available for Mac too, even more applications are possible.
